Why islands are easier to invade: human influences on bullfrog invasion in the Zhoushan archipelago and neighboring mainland China,"Islands are often considered easier to invade than mainland locations because of lower biotic resistance, but this hypothesis is difficult to test. We compared invasion success (the probability of establishing a wild reproducing population) for bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) introduced to enclosures on 26 farms on islands in the Zhoushan archipelago and 15 farms in neighboring mainland China. Bullfrogs were more likely to invade farms located on islands with lower native frog species richness than mainland farms, consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis. However, human frog hunting pressure also differed between islands and the mainland and, along with the number of bullfrogs raised in enclosures, was a stronger predictor of invasion success than native frog richness in multiple regression. Variation in hunting pressure was also able to account for the difference in invasion success between islands and mainlands: islands had lower hunting pressure and thus higher invasion probability. We conclude that the ease with which bullfrogs have invaded islands of the Zhoushan archipelago relative to the mainland has little to do with biotic resistance but results from variation in factors under human control.","Why islands are easier to invade: human influences on bullfrog invasion in the Zhoushan archipelago and neighboring mainland China [SEP] Islands are often considered easier to invade than mainland locations because of lower biotic resistance, but this hypothesis is difficult to test.

"The introduction of Littorina littorea to British Columbia, Canada: potential impacts and the importance of biotic resistance by native predators","Although the establishment and spread of non-indigenous species depends upon survival in the face of novel environmental conditions and novel biological interactions, relatively little attention has been focused on the specific role of native predators in limiting invasion success. The European common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was recently introduced to the Pacific coast of Canada and provides a case study of an introduction into an area with an important predator guild (sea stars) that is functionally minor in the invader's native habitat. Here, we assess the likelihood of establishment, spread, and negative ecological impact of this introduced gastropod, with an emphasis on the role of native sea stars as agents of biotic resistance. Size frequency distributions and local market availability suggest that L. littorea was most likely introduced via the live seafood trade. Non-native hitchhikers (e.g., the trematode Cryptocotyle lingua) were found on/in both market and field specimens. Laboratory studies and field observations confirmed that L. littorea can survive seasonal low salinity in Vancouver, British Columbia. Periwinkles also readily consumed native Ulva, suggesting that periwinkles could impact native communities via herbivory or resource competition. Unlike native gastropods, however, L. littorea lacked behavioural avoidance responses to Northeast Pacific predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus and Pycnopodia helianthoides), and sea star predation rates on L. littorea were much higher than predation rates on native turban snails (Chlorostoma funebralis) in common garden experiments. We therefore expect periwinkle establishment in British Columbia to be limited to areas with low predator density, as is seen in its field distribution to date. We caution that this conclusion may understate the importance of the L. littorea introduction if it also serves as a vector for additional non-indigenous species such as C. lingua.","The introduction of Littorina littorea to British Columbia, Canada: potential impacts and the importance of biotic resistance by native predators [SEP] Although the establishment and spread of non-indigenous species depends upon survival in the face of novel environmental conditions and novel biological interactions, relatively little attention has been focused on the specific role of native predators in limiting invasion success.

Species evenness and invasion resistance of experimental grassland communities,"Concern for biodiversity loss coupled with the accelerated rate of biological invasions has provoked much interest in assessing how native plant species diversity affects invasibility. Although experimental studies extensively document the effects of species richness on invader performance, the role of species evenness in such studies is rarely examined. Species evenness warrants more attention because the relative abundances of species can account for substantially more of the variance in plant community diversity and tend to change more rapidly and more frequently in response to disturbances than the absolute numbers of species. In this study, we experimentally manipulated species evenness within native prairie grassland mesocosms. We assessed how evenness affected primary productivity, light availability and the resistance of native communities to invasion. The primary productivity of native communities increased significantly with species evenness, and this increase in productivity was accompanied by significant decreases in light availability. However, evenness had no effect on native community resistance to invasion by three common exotic invasive species. In this study, niche complementarity provides a potential mechanism for the effects of evenness on productivity and light availability, but these effects apparently were not strong enough to alter the invasibility of the experimental communities. Our results suggest that species evenness enhances community productivity but provides no benefit to invasion resistance in otherwise functionally diverse communities.","Species evenness and invasion resistance of experimental grassland communities [SEP] Concern for biodiversity loss coupled with the accelerated rate of biological invasions has provoked much interest in assessing how native plant species diversity affects invasibility.

Native macrophyte density and richness affect the invasiveness of a tropical Poaceae species,"The role of the native species richness and density in ecosystem invasibility is a matter of concern for both ecologists and managers. We tested the hypothesis that the invasiveness of Urochloa arrecta (non-native in the Neotropics) is negatively affected by the species richness and abundance of native aquatic macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems. We first created four levels of macrophyte richness in a greenhouse (richness experiment), and we then manipulated the densities of the same native species in a second experiment (density experiment). When the native macrophytes were adults, fragments of U. arrecta were added, and their growth was assessed. Our results from the richness experiment corroborated the hypothesis of a negative relationship between the native species richness and the growth of U. arrecta, as measured by sprout length and root biomass. However, the resistance to invasion was not attributed to the presence of a particular native species with a greater competitive ability. In the density experiment, U. arrecta growth decreased significantly with an increased density of all five of the native species. Density strongly affected the performance of the Poaceae in a negative manner, suggesting that patches that are densely colonized by native macrophytes and less subject to disturbances will be more resistant to invasion than those that are poorly colonized and more commonly subjected to disturbances. Our density experiment also showed that some species exhibit a higher competitive ability than others (sampling effect). Although native richness and abundance clearly limit the colonization and establishment of U. arrecta, these factors cannot completely prevent the invasion of aquatic ecosystems by this Poaceae species.","Native macrophyte density and richness affect the invasiveness of a tropical Poaceae species [SEP] The role of the native species richness and density in ecosystem invasibility is a matter of concern for both ecologists and managers.

Functional group dominance and identity effects influence the magnitude of grassland invasion,"1. Variation in functional community composition is expected to influence the extent of exotic species invasions. Yet, whether resident functional groups control invasion through their relative biomass (mass ratio hypothesis) or by traits other than biomass (identity hypothesis) remains poorly understood. 2. We performed a 6-year experiment to determine the effects of removing different functional groups on exotic species biomass in a Flooding Pampa grassland, Argentina. Functional groups were defined by life-form (grasses or forbs), phenology (winter or summer) and origin (native or exotic). Removal of each functional group was compared against the removal of an equivalent amount of random biomass. Exotic group responses were monitored over 4years of continuous removals, and after 2years of recovery without manipulations. 3. Removal of dominant native summer grasses caused the greatest impact on exotic species and overall community composition. Native summer-grass removal significantly increased exotic grass (120%) and forb (730%) biomass beyond the level (46% and 180%, respectively) expected from deleting a similar amount of biomass at random. Exotic annual grasses showed only a transient increase, whereas exotic forb invasion persisted even after 2years without removals. 4. Removing subordinate, native or exotic winter grasses, and rare native forbs significantly promoted exotic forbs, but to the same level (300%) as random biomass removals. Total grass removal increased exotic forbs to half the extent expected from adding the effects of single grass group removals. Dispersal limitation and harsh abiotic conditions may constrain exotic forb spread into such heavily grass-depleted patches. 5. Synthesis. The impact of losing a functional group on the magnitude and persistence of invasion reflected its relative contribution to community biomass. Identity attributes other than biomass (e.g. phenological niche) further enhanced the biotic control that dominant native grasses exerted on established exotic species. Our findings highlight the community legacies of past disturbances to dominant functional groups.","Functional group dominance and identity effects influence the magnitude of grassland invasion [SEP] 1.

Native plant diversity increases herbivory to non-natives,"There is often an inverse relationship between the diversity of a plant community and the invasibility of that community by non-native plants. Native herbivores that colonize novel plants may contribute to diversity-invasibility relationships by limiting the relative success of non-native plants. Here, we show that, in large collections of non-native oak trees at sites across the USA, non-native oaks introduced to regions with greater oak species richness accumulated greater leaf damage than in regions with low oak richness. Underlying this trend was the ability of herbivores to exploit non-native plants that were close relatives to their native host. In diverse oak communities, non-native trees were on average more closely related to native trees and received greater leaf damage than those in depauperate oak communities. Because insect herbivores colonize non-native plants that are similar to their native hosts, in communities with greater native plant diversity, non-natives experience greater herbivory.","Native plant diversity increases herbivory to non-natives [SEP] There is often an inverse relationship between the diversity of a plant community and the invasibility of that community by non-native plants.

Do biodiversity and human impact influence the introduction or establishment of alien mammals?,"What determines the number of alien species in a given region? 'Native biodiversity' and 'human impact' are typical answers to this question. Indeed, studies comparing different regions have frequently found positive relationships between number of alien species and measures of both native biodiversity (e.g. the number of native species) and human impact (e.g. human population). These relationships are typically explained by biotic acceptance or resistance, i.e. by influence of native biodiversity and human impact on the second step of the invasion process, establishment. The first step of the invasion process, introduction, has often been ignored. Here we investigate whether relationships between number of alien mammals and native biodiversity or human impact in 43 European countries are mainly shaped by differences in number of introduced mammals or establishment success. Our results suggest that correlation between number of native and established mammals is spurious, as it is simply explainable by the fact that both quantities are linked to country area. We also demonstrate that countries with higher human impact host more alien mammals than other countries because they received more introductions than other countries. Differences in number of alien mammals cannot be explained by differences in establishment success. Our findings highlight importance of human activities and question, at least for mammals in Europe, importance of biotic acceptance and resistance.","Do biodiversity and human impact influence the introduction or establishment of alien mammals?

"Native and introduced gastropods in laurel forests on Tenerife, Canary Islands","The introduction of non-native gastropods on islands has repetitively been related to a decline of the endemic fauna. So far, no quantitative information is available even for the native gastropod fauna from the laurel forests (the so-called Laurisilva) of the Canary Islands. Much of the original laurel forest has been logged in recent centuries. Based on vegetation studies, we hypothesized that densities and the number of introduced species decline with the age of the regrowth forests. We sampled 27 sites from which we collected thirty native and seven introduced species. Two introduced species, Milax nigricans and Oxychilus alliarius, were previously not reported from the Canary Islands. Assemblage composition was mainly structured by disturbance history and attitude. Overall species richness was correlated with slope inclination, prevalence of rocky outcrops, amounts of woody debris and leaf litter depth. Densities were correlated with the depth of the litter layer and the extent of herb layer cover and laurel canopy cover. Introduced species occurred in 22 sites but were neither related to native species richness nor to the time that elapsed since forest regrowth. One introduced slug, Lehmannia valentiana, is already widespread, with densities strongly related to herb cover. Overall species richness seemed to be the outcome of invasibility, thus factors enhancing species richness likely also enhance invasibility. Although at present introduced species contribute to diversity, the potential competition between introduced slugs and the rich native semi-slug fauna, and the effects of introduced predatory snails (Oxychilus spp. and Testacella maugei) warrant further monitoring.

Stress and land-use legacies alter the relationship between invasive- and native- plant richness,"QuestionsDoes the driver of native richness impact invasion-diversity relationships?

Do invasion-diversity relationships change when abiotic and biotic legacies, rather than stress, act as non-selective drivers of richness? LocationCalcareous fens, Wisconsin, USA. MethodsWe compared plot-level relationships between native and invasive species richness in 220 plots in 11 calcareous fens, six of which had stress alleviation and community impoverishment due to historic ploughing. We measured nutrient availability (resource stress) and saturation stress (non-resource stress), native richness and invasive richness in each plot. ResultsResidual maximum likelihood (REML) regression found a negative correlation between native and invasive richness in never ploughed plots, but no relationship was found in ploughed plots. REML multiple regression found that after accounting for saturation and nutrients, there was no relationship between native and invasive richness in ploughed or never ploughed plots. Saturation stress predicted low invasive richness and high native richness in never ploughed plots. Time since abandonment did not predict invasive richness. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) found most invasive species present only in areas with the least saturation stress. ConclusionsNegative relationships between native and invasive richness can result when the main driver of native richness favour native species (such as stress), and therefore may not support the diversity-resistance hypothesis.

Functional composition controls invasion success in a California serpentine grassland,"P>1. Recent debates about the role of biotic resistance in controlling invasion success have focused on effects of species richness. However, functional composition could be a stronger control: species already in the community with similar functional traits to those of the invaders should have the greatest competitive effect on invaders. Still, experiments assessing effects of functional similarity have found contradictory results. 2. We used experimental communities in a serpentine grassland in California, USA, to assess the extent to which functional composition and functional diversity influenced success of two different types of invading plants: early season annuals (E) and late-season annuals (L) that have been previously shown to differ in patterns of resource acquisition. 3. We seeded known quantities of seed of six different species (three in each functional group) into experimental plots containing established communities differing in functional composition and functional diversity. The experimental communities contained different combinations of E, L, perennial bunchgrass (P) and nitrogen-fixer (N) functional groups, with functional diversity ranging from 0 to 4 groups. Each invading species was seeded into a separate quadrat within each plot to minimize competitive effects of invaders on each other. We measured both seedling and adult success of invaders for two full growing seasons to further understand mechanisms underlying biotic resistance. 4. More functionally diverse communities were less invaded overall, as measured by the average success of individual invaders. However, assessment of invaders by functional groups was more informative: Es in the extant community suppressed E invaders the most, and Ls in the extant community suppressed L invaders the most. 5. We observed a variety of interactions among extant functional groups in reducing invader success, including synergism, complementarity and 'basement' effects, where two or more groups negatively affected invaders, but combinations of groups were no more suppressive than single groups. The extant community influenced invaders more strongly through suppression of adult plant growth than through effects on seedling establishment. 6. Synthesis. Contrary to predictions from neutral theory, these results indicate that niche overlap was an important component of biotic resistance in these experimental plant communities and summed up to significant effects of species richness.","Functional composition controls invasion success in a California serpentine grassland [SEP] P>1.

Determinants of establishment success in introduced birds,"A major component of human-induced global change is the deliberate or accidental translocation of species from their native ranges to alien environments(1,2), where they may cause substantial environmental and economic damage(3,4). Thus we need to understand why some introductions succeed while others fail. Successful introductions tend to be concentrated in certain regions(2), especially islands and the temperate zone, suggesting that species-rich mainland and tropical locations are harder to invade because of greater biotic resistance(1,5-9). However, this pattern could also reflect variation in the suitability of the abiotic environment at introduction locations for the species introduced(3,9-11), coupled with known confounding effects of non-random selection of species and locations for introduction(8,12-14). Here, we test these alternative hypotheses using a global data set of historical bird introductions, employing a statistical framework that accounts for differences among species and regions in terms of introduction success. By removing these confounding effects, we show that the pattern of avian introduction success is not consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis. Instead, success depends on the suitability of the abiotic environment for the exotic species at the introduction site.","Determinants of establishment success in introduced birds [SEP] A major component of human-induced global change is the deliberate or accidental translocation of species from their native ranges to alien environments(1,2), where they may cause substantial environmental and economic damage(3,4).

Here, we test these alternative hypotheses using a global data set of historical bird introductions, employing a statistical framework that accounts for differences among species and regions in terms of introduction success. By removing these confounding effects, we show that the pattern of avian introduction success is not consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis. Instead, success depends on the suitability of the abiotic environment for the exotic species at the introduction site.","1-0-0,4",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Plant diversity, herbivory and resistance of a plant community to invasion in Mediterranean annual communities","Several components of the diversity of plant communities, such as species richness, species composition, number of functional groups and functional composition, have been shown to directly affect the performance of exotic species. Exotics can also be affected by herbivores of the native plant community. However, these two possible mechanisms limiting invasion have never been investigated together. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plant diversity, herbivory and performance of two annual exotics, Conyza bonariensis and C. canadensis, in Mediterranean annual communities. We wanted to test whether herbivory of these exotics was influenced either by species richness, functional-group richness or functional-group composition. We also studied the relationship between herbivory on the exotic species and their performance. Herbivory increased with increasing species and functional-group richness for both Conyza species. These patterns are interpreted as reflecting a greater number of available herbivore niches in a richer, more complex, plant community. The identities of functional groups also affected Conyza herbivory, which decreased in the presence of Asteraceae or Fabaceae and increased in the presence of Poaceae. Increasing herbivory had consequences for vegetative and demographic parameters of both invasive species: survival, final biomass and net fecundity decreased with increasing herbivory, leading to a loss of reproductive capacity. We conclude that communities characterised by a high number of grass species instead of Asteraceae or Fabaceae may be more resistant to invasion by the two Conyza species, in part due to predation by native herbivores.","Plant diversity, herbivory and resistance of a plant community to invasion in Mediterranean annual communities [SEP] Several components of the diversity of plant communities, such as species richness, species composition, number of functional groups and functional composition, have been shown to directly affect the performance of exotic species.

Filling in the gaps: modelling native species richness and invasions using spatially incomplete data,"Detailed knowledge of patterns of native species richness, an important component of biodiversity, and non-native species invasions is often lacking even though this knowledge is essential to conservation efforts. However, we cannot afford to wait for complete information on the distribution and abundance of native and harmful invasive species. Using information from counties well surveyed for plants across the USA, we developed models to fill data gaps in poorly surveyed areas by estimating the density (number of species km(-2)) of native and non-native plant species. Here, we show that native plant species density is non-random, predictable, and is the best predictor of non-native plant species density. We found that eastern agricultural sites and coastal areas are among the most invaded in terms of non-native plant species densities, and that the central USA appears to have the greatest ratio of non-native to native species. These large-scale models could also be applied to smaller spatial scales or other taxa to set priorities for conservation and invasion mitigation, prevention, and control efforts.","Filling in the gaps: modelling native species richness and invasions using spatially incomplete data [SEP] Detailed knowledge of patterns of native species richness, an important component of biodiversity, and non-native species invasions is often lacking even though this knowledge is essential to conservation efforts.

"Biodiversity, invasion resistance, and marine ecosystem function: Reconciling pattern and process","A venerable generalization about community resistance to invasions is that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. However, results of experimental and observational studies often conflict, leading to vigorous debate about the mechanistic importance of diversity in determining invasion success in the field, a well as other ecosystem properties, such as productivity and stability. In this study, we employed both field experiments and observational approaches to assess the effects of diversity on the invasion of a subtidal marine invertebrate community by three species of nonindigenous ascidians (sea squirts). In experimentally assembled communities, decreasing native diversity increased the survival and final percent cover of invaders, whereas the abundance of individual species had no effect on these measures of invasion success. Increasing native diversity also decreased the availability of open space, We limiting resource in this system, by buffering against fluctuations in the cover of individual species. This occurred because temporal patterns of abundance differed among species, so space was most consistently and completely occupied when more species were present. When we held diversity constant, but manipulated resource availability, we found that the settlement and recruitment of new invaders dramatically increased with increasing availability of open space. This suggests that the effect of diversity on invasion success is largely due to its effects on resource (space) availability. Apart from invasion resistance, the increased temporal stability found in more diverse communities may itself be considered an enhancement of ecosystem function. In field surveys, we found a strong negative correlation between native-species richness and the number and frequency of normative invaders at the scale of both a single quadrat (25 X 25 cm), and an entire site (50 X 50 in). Such a pattern suggests that the means by which diversity affects invasion resistance in our experiments is important in determining the distribution of invasive species in the field. Further synthesis of mechanistic and observational approaches should be encouraged, as this will increase our understanding of the conditions under which diversity does (and does not) play an important role in determining the distribution of invaders in the field.","Biodiversity, invasion resistance, and marine ecosystem function: Reconciling pattern and process [SEP] A venerable generalization about community resistance to invasions is that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion.

Invasion by Heracleum mantegazzianum in different habitats in the Czech Republic,"Heracleum mantegazzianum, a tall forb from the western Caucasus invaded several different habitats in the Czech Republic. The relation between invasion success and type of recipient habitat was studied in the Slavkovsky les hilly ridge, Czech Republic. The vegetation of 14 habitat types a occurring in an area of ca. 25 km(2) was analysed using phytosociological releves, and the invasion success of Heracleum (in terms of number of localities, area covered and proportion of available area occupied) was recorded separately in each of them. Site conditions were expressed indirectly using Ellenberg indicator values. The hypothesis tested was that Heracleum spreads in the majority of vegetation types regardless of the properties of the recipient vegetation. Community invasibility appeared to be affected by site conditions and the composition of the recipient vegetation. The species is not found in acidic habitats. Disturbed habitats with good possibilities of dispersal for Heracleum seeds are more easily invaded. Communities with a higher proportion of phanerophytes and of species with CS (Competitive/Stress-tolerating) strategy were more resistant to invasion. The invasion success was bigger in sites with increased possibilities of spread for Heracleum diaspores. Communities invaded by Heracleum had a lower species diversity and a higher indicator value for nitrogen than not-invaded stands. It appears that species contributing to community resistance against invasion of Heracleum, or capable of persisting in Heracleum-invaded stands, have similar ecological requirements but a different life strategy to the invader.","Invasion by Heracleum mantegazzianum in different habitats in the Czech Republic [SEP] Heracleum mantegazzianum, a tall forb from the western Caucasus invaded several different habitats in the Czech Republic.

Phosphorus addition reduces invasion of a longleaf pine savanna (Southeastern USA) by a non-indigenous grass (Imperata cylindrica),"Imperata cylindrica is an invasive C-4 grass, native to Asia and increasing in frequency throughout the tropics, subtropics, and southeastern USA. Such increases are associated with reduced biodiversity, altered fire regimes, and a more intense competitive environment for commercially important species. We measured rates of clonal spread by I. cylindrica from a roadside edge into the interior of two longleaf pine savannas. In addition, we measured the effects of fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus on clonal invasion of one of these sites. Clonal invasion occurred at both sites and at similar rates. Older portions of an I. cylindrica sward contained fewer species of native pine-savanna plants. Clonal growth rates and aboveground mass of I. cylindrica were reduced by the addition of phosphorus relative to controls by the second growing season at one site. As a group, native species were not affected much by P-addition, although the height of legumes was increased by P addition, and the percent cover of legumes relative to native non-legumes decreased with increasing expected P limitation (i.e., going from P-fertilized to controls to N-fertilized treatments). Clonal invasion was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of legumes in control plots but not in P-fertilized plots. Species richness and percent cover of native plants ( both legumes and non-legumes) were dramatically lower in N-fertilized plots than in controls or P-fertilized plots. Species richness of native plants was negatively correlated with final aboveground mass of I. cylindrica in control and P-fertilized plots, but not in N-fertilized plots. The results suggest that I. cylindrica is a better competitor for phosphorus than are native pine-savanna plants, especially legumes, and that short-lived, high-level pulses of phosphorus addition reduce this competitive advantage without negatively affecting native plant diversity. Ratios of soil P to N or native legume to non-legume plant species may provide indicators of the resistance of pristine pine savannas to clonal invasion by I. cylindrica.","Phosphorus addition reduces invasion of a longleaf pine savanna (Southeastern USA) by a non-indigenous grass (Imperata cylindrica) [SEP] Imperata cylindrica is an invasive C-4 grass, native to Asia and increasing in frequency throughout the tropics, subtropics, and southeastern USA.

"Phalaris arundinacea seedling establishment: effects of canopy complexity in fen, mesocosm, and restoration experiments","Phalaris arundinacea L.

In this study, the effect of plant canopies on the establishment of P. arundinacea from seed in a fen, fen-like mesocosms, and a fen restoration site was assessed. In Wingra Fen, canopies that were more resistant to P. arundinacea establishment had more species (eight or nine versus four to six species) and higher cover of Aster firmus. In mesocosms planted with Glyceria striata plus 1, 6, or 15 native species, all canopies closed rapidly and prevented P. arundinacea establishment from seed, regardless of the density of the matrix species or the number of added species. Only after gaps were created in the canopy was P. arundinacea able to establish seedlings; then, the 15-species treatment reduced establishment to 48% of that for single-species canopies. A similar experiment in the restoration site produced less cover of native plants, and P. arundinacea recruited more readily. Results suggest that, where conditions are favorable for native plant growth, even species-poor canopies can inhibit P. arundinacea establishment from seed, but when disturbances create gaps, species-rich canopies confer greater resistance to invasion.","Phalaris arundinacea seedling establishment: effects of canopy complexity in fen, mesocosm, and restoration experiments [SEP] Phalaris arundinacea L.

Diversity-invasibility relationships across multiple scales in disturbed forest understoreys,"Non-native plant species richness may be either negatively or positively correlated with native species due to differences in resource availability, propagule pressure or the scale of vegetation sampling. We investigated the relationships between these factors and both native and non-native plant species at 12 mainland and island forested sites in southeastern Ontario, Canada. In general, the presence of non-native species was limited: < 20% of all species at a site were non-native and non-native species cover was < 4% m(-2) at 11 of the 12 sites. Non-native species were always positively correlated with native species, regardless of spatial scale and whether islands were sampled. Additionally, islands had a greater abundance of non-native species. Non-native species richness across mainland sites was significantly negatively correlated with mean shape index, a measure of the ratio of forest edge to area, and positively correlated with the mean distance to the nearest forest patch. Other factors associated with disturbance and propagule pressure in northeastern North America forests, including human land use, white-tailed deer populations, understorey light, and soil nitrogen, did not explain non-native richness nor cover better than the null models. Our results suggest that management strategies for controlling non-native plant invasions should aim to reduce the propagule pressure associated with human activities, and maximize the connectivity of forest habitats to benefit more poorly dispersed native species.","Diversity-invasibility relationships across multiple scales in disturbed forest understoreys [SEP] Non-native plant species richness may be either negatively or positively correlated with native species due to differences in resource availability, propagule pressure or the scale of vegetation sampling.

The roles of biotic resistance and nitrogen deposition in regulating non-native understory plant diversity,"Understanding the mechanisms that allow for plant invasions is important for both ecologists and land managers, due to both the environmental and economic impacts of native biodiversity losses. We conducted an observational field study in 2008 to examine the relationship between native and non-native forest understory plant species and to investigate the influence of soil nitrogen (N) on plant community richness and diversity. In 2009, we conducted a companion fertilization experiment to investigate how various forms of N deposition (inorganic and organic) influenced native and non-native species richness and diversity. We found that native species richness and diversity were negatively correlated with 1) non-native species richness and diversity and 2) higher total soil inorganic N. In the deposition experiment, adding organic N fertilizers decreased native richness and diversity compared to inorganic N fertilizers. Together, these results indicate that increasing soil N can be detrimental to native species; however, native species richness and diversity may counteract the N-stimulation of non-native species. Furthermore, the negative effects of organic N deposition on native plants may be just as strong, if not stronger, than the effects of inorganic N deposition.","The roles of biotic resistance and nitrogen deposition in regulating non-native understory plant diversity [SEP] Understanding the mechanisms that allow for plant invasions is important for both ecologists and land managers, due to both the environmental and economic impacts of native biodiversity losses.

Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between number of native and alien woody plant species. From the 1980s to 2013, the number of woody species increased from 76 to 116. The share of alien species also increased from 29.3% to 45.7%. We found a positive relationship between richness of alien and native woody species, which explains 46% of variance.

The positive relationship between number of native and alien woody species shows the wider base of ""the rich get richer"" concept, so treated separately, woody species may be determinants of dynamic processes in vegetation. Due to recent manifestations of invasive potential of some species, their invasion probability may be underestimated.

Native Predators Do Not Influence Invasion Success of Pacific Lionfish on Caribbean Reefs,"Biotic resistance, the process by which new colonists are excluded from a community by predation from and/or competition with resident species, can prevent or limit species invasions. We examined whether biotic resistance by native predators on Caribbean coral reefs has influenced the invasion success of red lionfishes (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles), piscivores from the Indo-Pacific. Specifically, we surveyed the abundance (density and biomass) of lionfish and native predatory fishes that could interact with lionfish (either through predation or competition) on 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions of the Caribbean. We recorded protection status of the reefs, and abiotic variables including depth, habitat type, and wind/wave exposure at each site. We found no relationship between the density or biomass of lionfish and that of native predators. However, lionfish densities were significantly lower on windward sites, potentially because of habitat preferences, and in marine protected areas, most likely because of ongoing removal efforts by reserve managers. Our results suggest that interactions with native predators do not influence the colonization or post-establishment population density of invasive lionfish on Caribbean reefs.","Native Predators Do Not Influence Invasion Success of Pacific Lionfish on Caribbean Reefs [SEP] Biotic resistance, the process by which new colonists are excluded from a community by predation from and/or competition with resident species, can prevent or limit species invasions. We examined whether biotic resistance by native predators on Caribbean coral reefs has influenced the invasion success of red lionfishes (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles), piscivores from the Indo-Pacific. Specifically, we surveyed the abundance (density and biomass) of lionfish and native predatory fishes that could interact with lionfish (either through predation or competition) on 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions of the Caribbean. We recorded protection status of the reefs, and abiotic variables including depth, habitat type, and wind/wave exposure at each site. We found no relationship between the density or biomass of lionfish and that of native predators. However, lionfish densities were significantly lower on windward sites, potentially because of habitat preferences, and in marine protected areas, most likely because of ongoing removal efforts by reserve managers.

Exotic taxa less related to native species are more invasive,"Some species introduced into new geographical areas from their native ranges wreak ecological and economic havoc in their new environment. Although many studies have searched for either species or habitat characteristics that predict invasiveness of exotic species, the match between characteristics of the invader and those of members of the existing native community may be essential to understanding invasiveness. Here, we find that one metric, the phylogenetic relatedness of an invader to the native community, provides a predictive tool for invasiveness. Using a phylogenetic supertree of all grass species in California, we show that highly invasive grass species are, on average, significantly less related to native grasses than are introduced but noninvasive grasses. The match between the invader and the existing native community may explain why exotic pest species are not uniformly noxious in all novel habitats. Relatedness of invaders to the native biota may be one useful criterion for prioritizing management efforts of exotic species.","Exotic taxa less related to native species are more invasive [SEP] Some species introduced into new geographical areas from their native ranges wreak ecological and economic havoc in their new environment.

Validity of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis relates to the stages of invasion,"Naturalization is the introduction and establishment of a nonnative species with sustainable populations in a novel environment. The success of nonnative species may be influenced by their relatedness to the native flora. Darwin proposed that if a nonnative plant species is introduced into an environment without native congeners, the nonnative species will have a greater chance of becoming naturalized. To test Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, we compiled a Kentucky plant database consisting of 821 vascular plant species and subsequently selected species traits and distribution information to determine the effect of congeneric species and traits on the probability of successful naturalization and invasion. The predictors used include reproductive traits, growth form, abundance, habitat type, native congeners, and biogeographical origin. We fit three sets of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial family and a logit link. Backward selection based on minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used in the analyses. Our results from these three sets of models clearly indicate that the validity of Darwin's hypothesis is invasion stage dependent. More specific, the naturalized and invasive models (predicting the probability of being naturalized and invasive respectively) did not support Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. The number of native congeners had no effect on the likelihood that a particular species would naturalize and become invasive. Our results suggest that Darwin's naturalization hypothesis is more relevant during the early stage of establishment as demonstrated by the native model (predicting the probability of being native) and it becomes irrelevant during the late stages of invasion as indicated by the naturalized and invasive models. Thus, it can be generalized that biotic interactions, especially competition, is a critical determinant of initial success for nonnative species in the recipient communities. Once established, the fate of nonnative species during the late stages of invasion may be more related to other factors such as biogeographic origin and habitat conditions. Furthermore, we found reproductive traits such as flowering phenology and flower type are associated with invasion success. We also recognized contrasting traits between native and nonnative species, indicating niche differentiation between these two groups of species. Niche overlapping was found as well among species regardless of the status of being native or otherwise. Our study provides a novel approach to advance the understanding of phylogenetic relatedness between nonnative species and native flora by integrating traits and niche concepts at the regional scale.","Validity of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis relates to the stages of invasion [SEP] Naturalization is the introduction and establishment of a nonnative species with sustainable populations in a novel environment.

Distinctiveness magnifies the impact of biological invaders in aquatic ecosystems,"There exist few empirical rules for the effects of introduced species, reflecting the context-dependent nature of biological invasions. A promising approach toward developing generalizations is to explore hypotheses that incorporate characteristics of both the invader and the recipient system. We present the first general test of the hypothesis that an invader's impact is determined by the system's evolutionary experience with similar species. Through a meta-analysis, we compared the taxonomic distinctiveness of high- and low-impact invaders in several aquatic systems. We find that high-impact invaders (i.e. those that displace native species) are more likely to belong to genera not already present in the system.","Distinctiveness magnifies the impact of biological invaders in aquatic ecosystems [SEP] There exist few empirical rules for the effects of introduced species, reflecting the context-dependent nature of biological invasions.

Enemy damage of exotic plant species is similar to that of natives and increases with productivity,"1. In their colonized ranges, exotic plants may be released from some of the herbivores or pathogens of their home ranges but these can be replaced by novel enemies. It is of basic and practical interest to understand which characteristics of invaded communities control accumulation of the new pests. Key questions are whether enemy load on exotic species is smaller than on native competitors as suggested by the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) and whether this difference is most pronounced in resource-rich habitats as predicted by the resource-enemy release hypothesis (R-ERH). 2. In 72 populations of 12 exotic invasive species, we scored all visible above-ground damage morphotypes caused by herbivores and fungal pathogens. In addition, we quantified levels of leaf herbivory and fruit damage. We then assessed whether variation in damage diversity and levels was explained by habitat fertility, by relatedness between exotic species and the native community or rather by native species diversity. 3. In a second part of the study, we also tested the ERH and the R-ERH by comparing damage of plants in 28 pairs of co-occurring native and exotic populations, representing nine congeneric pairs of native and exotic species. 4. In the first part of the study, diversity of damage morphotypes and damage levels of exotic populations were greater in resource-rich habitats. Co-occurrence of closely related, native species in the community significantly increased the probability of fruit damage. Herbivory on exotics was less likely in communities with high phylogenetic diversity. 5. In the second part of the study, exotic and native congeneric populations incurred similar damage diversity and levels, irrespective of whether they co-occurred in nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich habitats. 6. Synthesis. We identified habitat productivity as a major community factor affecting accumulation of enemy damage by exotic populations. Similar damage levels in exotic and native congeneric populations, even in species pairs from fertile habitats, suggest that the enemy release hypothesis or the R-ERH cannot always explain the invasiveness of introduced species.","Enemy damage of exotic plant species is similar to that of natives and increases with productivity [SEP] 1.

Plant invasions in Taiwan: Insights from the flora of casual and naturalized alien species,"Data on floristic status, biological attributes, chronology and distribution of naturalized species have been shown to be a very powerful tool for discerning the patterns of plant invasions and species invasiveness. We analysed the newly compiled list of casual and naturalized plant species in Taiwan (probably the only complete data set of this kind in East Asia) and found that Taiwan is relatively lightly invaded with only 8% of the flora being casual or naturalized. Moreover, the index of casual and naturalized species per log area is also moderate, in striking contrast with many other island floras where contributions of naturalized species are much higher. Casual and naturalized species have accumulated steadily and almost linearly over the past decades. Fabaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae are the families with the most species. However, Amaranthaceae, Convolvulaceae, and Onagraceae have the largest ratios of casual and naturalized species to their global numbers. Ipomoea, Solanum and Crotalaria have the highest numbers of casual and naturalized species. About 60% of all genera with exotic species are new to Taiwan. Perennial herbs represent one third of the casual and naturalized flora, followed by annual herbs. About 60% of exotic species were probably introduced unintentionally onto the island; many species imported intentionally have ornamental, medicinal, or forage values. The field status of 50% of these species is unknown, but ornamentals represent noticeable proportions of naturalized species, while forage species represent a relatively larger proportion of casual species. Species introduced for medicinal purposes seem to be less invasive. Most of the casual and naturalized species of Taiwan originated from the Tropical Americas, followed by Asia and Europe.","Plant invasions in Taiwan: Insights from the flora of casual and naturalized alien species [SEP] Data on floristic status, biological attributes, chronology and distribution of naturalized species have been shown to be a very powerful tool for discerning the patterns of plant invasions and species invasiveness.

"Colonization plasticity of the boring bivalve Lithophaga aristata (Dillwyn, 1817) on the Southeastern Brazilian coast: considerations on its invasiveness potential","Lithophaga aristata is a boring bivalve native to the Caribbean Sea, first recorded in 2005 as an introduced species on the Southeastern Brazilian coast. The geographic distribution and density of L. aristata and of its native congeneric L. bisulcata were assessed in four areas of Brazil (24 sites), additionally considering their relationship with types of substrate, depth and wave exposure. This study records the first occurrence of L. aristata in the Sepetiba Bay and also reports the species at five new localities in the Arraial do Cabo Bay. Lithophaga aristata is established in the four surveyed regions. At intertidal habitats, the exotic species only colonizes the infralittoral fringe but its density was not related to wave action. At subtidal habitats, the species colonizes natural and artificial substrates, from shallow (0.5m) to deep (5.0-7.0m) zones but no relationship between density and these evaluated factors was detected. Broad geographical and ecological distributions and higher densities of this introduced species in relation to its native congeneric are suggested as contrary to Darwin's naturalization hypothesis and instead indicate a high invasiveness potential.","Colonization plasticity of the boring bivalve Lithophaga aristata (Dillwyn, 1817) on the Southeastern Brazilian coast: considerations on its invasiveness potential [SEP] Lithophaga aristata is a boring bivalve native to the Caribbean Sea, first recorded in 2005 as an introduced species on the Southeastern Brazilian coast.

Impacts and interactions of multiple human perturbations in a California salt marsh,"Multiple disturbances to ecosystems can influence community structure by modifying resistance to and recovery from invasion by non-native species. Predicting how invasibility responds to multiple anthropogenic impacts is particularly challenging due to the variety of potential stressors and complex responses. Using manipulative field experiments, we examined the relative impact of perturbations that primarily change abiotic or biotic factors to promote invasion in coastal salt marsh plant communities. Specifically we test the hypotheses that nitrogen enrichment and human trampling facilitate invasion of upland weeds into salt marsh, and that the ability of salt marsh communities to resist and/or recover from invasion is modified by hydrological conditions. Nitrogen enrichment affected invasion of non-native upland plants at only one of six sites, and increased aboveground native marsh biomass at only two sites. Percent cover of native marsh plants declined with trampling at all sites, but recovered earlier at tidally flushed sites than at tidally restricted sites. Synergistic interactions between trampling and restricting tidal flow resulted in significantly higher cover of non-native upland plants in trampled plots at tidally restricted sites. Percent cover of non-native plants recovered to pre-trampling levels in fully tidal sites, but remained higher in tidally restricted sites after 22 months. Thus, perturbations that reduce biotic resistance interact with perturbations that alter abiotic conditions to promote invasion. This suggests that to effectively conserve or restore native biodiversity in altered systems, one must consider impacts of multiple human disturbances, and the interactions between them.","Impacts and interactions of multiple human perturbations in a California salt marsh [SEP] Multiple disturbances to ecosystems can influence community structure by modifying resistance to and recovery from invasion by non-native species.

Understory response to management treatments in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests,"A range of forest management treatments was applied to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in northern Arizona. The treatments represented the full range of existing stand disturbance conditions and included forest stands that were unmanaged, thinned, thinned and prescribed burned, and burned by stand-replacing wildfire in order of increasing disturbance intensity. We assessed differences in understory diversity associated with these treatments. We identified 195 species of understory plants. focusing on the distribution of natives and exotics. The abundance of understory plants was more sensitive to changes in management treatments than the overall species richness. Exotics on the whole, responded statistically more strongly to disturbance treatments than did natives. Both the richness and abundance of exotic forbs increased significantly with treatment intensity. Species richness remained stable while abundance of native graminoids increased significantly with treatment intensity through thinned and burned stands. Both then decreased significantly in stands that experienced wildfire. The number of native shrub species decreased significantly with treatment intensity. Overall plant diversity was least in the unmanaged stands and progressively increased with intensity of disturbance/stand treatments. Both prescribed burning and wildfire increased plant diversity; however, stand-replacing wildfire also appeared to substantially increase the diversity of exotic plants.

Interannual variation of fish assemblage structure in a Mediterranean River: Implications of streamflow on the dominance of native or exotic species,"Streams in mediterranean-type climate regions are shaped by predictable seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual cycle, but also present a strong interannual flow variation. The Guadiana River is one of the most important rivers in the Iberian Peninsula. The fish fauna presents 11 native freshwater species, including eight with high conservation status. Several exotic species are present, the most important being the American centrarchids pumpkinseed fish and largemouth bass. As a typical mediterranean-type river, the Guadiana has an irregular hydrological regime with severe drought periods and floods; the interannual variation of discharge presents a ratio of c. 100 to 1. From 1980 to 1995 several dry years were observed, culminating in the drought of 1991/92-1994/95. Analysing the variation of the fish assemblage structure during this period, exotic species (mostly pumpkinseed) progressively increased, strongly dominating in 1995. Indigenous populations dramatically decreased and a previously common endemic cyprinid (Anaecypris hispanica Steindachner) became endangered and one of the most threatened fishes of Europe. However, the following years presented above-average flows with several flood events and an inverse process occurred, with native species increasing their contribution in a short period. The importance of floods as a disturbance factor in the control of lentic or slow flowing water exotics is discussed. Native species apparently possess adaptive responses to high flows which exotics lack. This hypothesis is consistent with probability-of-use curves and preflood-postflood surveys. Results emphasize the importance of floods in the environmental flows of mediterranean-type rivers. In the absence of flooding disturbance, exotic fish populations predictably grow, increasing the pressure on native species; abiotic disturbance may supersede deterministic outcomes of predation or competition and influence community structure by reducing populations of the exotic species.

"Anthropogenic and environmental effects on invasive mammal distribution in northern Patagonia, Argentina","Anthropogenic disturbance is an important factor influencing biological invasions. The European hare (Lepus europaeus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) are invasive species known to cause substantial environmental damage, and were introduced to Argentina during the early 1900s. We compared the relative importance of anthropogenic and environmental factors in hare and boar occurrence in Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina, and assessed the hypothesis that invasion can occur regardless of anthropogenic disturbance. Also, we assessed whether hare and boar occupancy offered support for the disturbance hypothesis, which states that invasive species are facilitated by anthropogenic disturbance. We deployed 80 cameras from February to May 2012 and January to April 2013 and at each site measured three environmental (land cover, horizontal cover, and percentage herbaceous vegetation) and three anthropogenic (distance to nearest human settlement, distance to nearest road, and average daily number of people) variables. We used likelihood-based occupancy modeling to estimate site occurrence and detectability. We obtained 480 independent detections of hares and 134 of boars in 1680 camera days. Environmental factors had a greater effect on hare occupancy than anthropogenic disturbances, and hare occupancy was greater in more open areas and closer to human settlements, supporting both hypotheses. Boar occurrence was equally influenced by anthropogenic and environmental factors, and offered mixed support for both hypotheses; boars were present only in humid land covers, and occupancy was lesser closer to settlements but greater closer to roads. Species responses to anthropogenic and environmental factors can vary based on life history traits and role in human society. Identifying the effect of environmental factors and human disturbances on species is fundamental for allocating limited resources in management and conservation.

"The impact of fire, and its potential role in limiting the distribution of Bryophyllum delagoense (Crassulaceae) in southern Africa","Increasing emphasis has been placed on identifying traits of introduced species which predispose them to invade, and characteristics of ecosystems which make them susceptible to invasion. Habitat disturbance such as floods, fires and tree-falls may make ecosystems more prone to invasion. However, in this study the absence of fire was considered to be a factor in facilitating the invasion potential of a Madagascan endemic, Bryophyllum delagoense. Fire trials in South Africa killed 89 and 45% of B. delagoense plants in a high and low intensity controlled fire, respectively, with tall plants and those growing in clumps more likely to escape being killed. A reduction in the incidence and intensity of fires may therefore facilitate the invasion of B. delagoense and contribute to its invasive potential. Overgrazing, which reduces the frequency and intensity of fires probably facilitates the invasion of large and small succulent species. In South Africa, B. delagoense is still considered to be a minor weed or garden escape, despite its introduction to southern Africa 175 years earlier than in Australia, where it is extremely invasive. However, other succulents such as Opuntia species have become invasive on both continents, confounding our hypothesis that fire may be inhibiting B. delagoense from becoming invasive in southern Africa. However, closer analysis of Opuntia literature indicates that smaller species, similar in size to B. delagoense, are more likely to be killed, even by low intensity fires. We speculate that B. delagoense is more invasive in Australia because of a reduction in the frequency and intensity of fires and that fire is, amongst other factors, largely responsible for inhibiting its invasion potential in southern Africa.","The impact of fire, and its potential role in limiting the distribution of Bryophyllum delagoense (Crassulaceae) in southern Africa [SEP] Increasing emphasis has been placed on identifying traits of introduced species which predispose them to invade, and characteristics of ecosystems which make them susceptible to invasion.

Are invasive species the drivers or passengers of change in degraded ecosystems?,"Few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat loss and disturbance, leading to uncertainty whether dominant invasive species are driving community change or are passengers along for the environmental ride. The ""driver"" model predicts that invaded communities are highly interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded by competition from the exotic dominants. The ""passenger"" model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants, facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e., treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar species). This points toward the passenger model as the underlying cause of exotic dominance, although their combined effects (suppressive and facilitative) on community structure are substantial.","Are invasive species the drivers or passengers of change in degraded ecosystems?

"Human activity facilitates altitudinal expansion of exotic plants along a road in montane grassland, South Africa","Question: Do antropogenic activities facilitate the distribution of exotic plants along steep altitudinal gradients? Location: Sani Pass road. Grassland biome, South Africa. Methods: On both sides of this road. presence and abundance of exotic plants was recorded in four 25-m long road-verge plots and in parallel 25 m x 2 m adjacent land plots, nested at five altitudinal levels: 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400 and 2700 in a.s.l. Exotic community structure was analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis while a two-level nested Generalized Linear Model was fitted for richness and cover of exotics. We tested the upper altitudinal limits tor all exotics along this road for spatial clustering around four potential propagule sources Using a t-test. Results: Community structure, richness and abundance of exotics were negatively correlated with altitude. Greatest invasion by exotics was recorded for adjacent land at the 1500 in level. Of the 45 exotics, 16 were found at higher altitudes than expected and observations were spatially clustered around potential propagule sources. Conclusions: Spatial clustering of upper altitudinal limits around human inhabited areas suggests that exotics originate from these areas, while exceeding expected altitudinal limits suggests that distribution ranges of exotics are presently underestimated. Excites are generally characterised by a high propagule pressure and/or persistent seedbanks, thus future tarring of the Sani Pass may result in art increase of exotic species richness and abundance. This would initially result from construct ion-related soil disturbance and subsequently from increased traffic. water run-off, and altered fire frequency. We suggest examples of management actions to prevent this.","Human activity facilitates altitudinal expansion of exotic plants along a road in montane grassland, South Africa [SEP] Question: Do antropogenic activities facilitate the distribution of exotic plants along steep altitudinal gradients?

Fire effects on plant diversity in serpentine vs. sandstone chaparral,"Fire contributes to the maintenance of species diversity in many plant communities, but few studies have compared its impacts in similar communities that vary in such attributes as soils and productivity. We compared how a wildfire affected plant diversity in chaparral vegetation on serpentine and sandstone soils. We hypothesized that because biomass and cover are lower in serpentine chaparral, space and light are less limiting, and therefore postfire increases in plant species diversity would be lower than in sandstone chaparral. In 40 pairs of burned and unburned 250-m(2) plots, we measured changes in the plant community after a fire for three years. The diversity of native and exotic species increased more in response to fire in sandstone than serpentine chaparral, at both the local (plot) and regional (whole study) scales. In serpentine compared with sandstone chaparral, specialized fire-dependent species were less prevalent, mean fire Severity was lower, mean time since last fire was longer, postfire shrub recruitment was lower, and regrowth of biomass was slower. Within each chaparral type, the responses of diversity to fire were positively correlated with prefire shrub cover and with a number of measures of soil fertility. Fire severity was negatively related to the postfire change in diversity in sandstone chaparral, and unimodally related to the postfire change in diversity in serpentine chaparral. Our results suggest that the effects of fire on less productive plant communities like serpentine chaparral may be less pronounced, although longer lasting, than the effects of fire on similar but more productive communities.","Fire effects on plant diversity in serpentine vs. sandstone chaparral [SEP] Fire contributes to the maintenance of species diversity in many plant communities, but few studies have compared its impacts in similar communities that vary in such attributes as soils and productivity.

"Assessing bird assemblages along an urban gradient in a Caribbean island (Margarita, Venezuela)","Several studies have shown that urbanization usually leads to severe biotic homogenizing, i.e. the local extirpation of many native species and the expansion to regional scales of a small group of ""urban-adaptors"", some of them exotics. Margarita Island (Venezuela) is a tropical Caribbean island that has undergone an accelerated urban development in the last 40 years. Because the island also has a high bird diversity with several endemic and threatened species, we evaluated the effect of urban development on bird species richness, assemblage structure, seasonal changes and feeding guilds. We defined an urban gradient from areas with high vegetation cover (remnant woodlands) through areas with intermediate vegetation (traditional towns) to areas with next to no vegetation (recent suburbs). Each experimental unit was replicated 3 times and birds were surveyed during the dry and rainy seasons. Richness decreased as urbanization increased, being severely depleted in the recent suburbs. The bird assemblage consisted of native species, including six endemic sub-species, but only one exotic, Columba livia. There were no seasonal changes in assemblage structure. We identified the species most tolerant and most sensitive to urbanization. Omnivorous birds were common along the gradient and granivores were also tolerant to urban development. Specialized insectivores and frugivores were the most negatively affected groups. The considerable amount of native woodland and other vegetation present in the traditional towns we evaluated, and their proximity to natural protected areas, favors the persistence of native bird species in these urban areas on Margarita Island.","Assessing bird assemblages along an urban gradient in a Caribbean island (Margarita, Venezuela) [SEP] Several studies have shown that urbanization usually leads to severe biotic homogenizing, i.e. the local extirpation of many native species and the expansion to regional scales of a small group of ""urban-adaptors"", some of them exotics.

Altered stream-flow regimes and invasive plant species: the Tamarix case,"Aim To test the hypothesis that anthropogenic alteration of stream-flow regimes is a key driver of compositional shifts from native to introduced riparian plant species. Location The arid south-western United States; 24 river reaches in the Gila and Lower Colorado drainage basins of Arizona. Methods We compared the abundance of three dominant woody riparian taxa (native Populus fremontii and Salix gooddingii, and introduced Tamarix) between river reaches that varied in stream-flow permanence (perennial vs. intermittent), presence or absence of an upstream flow-regulating dam, and presence or absence of municipal effluent as a stream water source. Results Populus and Salix were the dominant pioneer trees along the reaches with perennial flow and a natural flood regime. In contrast, Tamarix had high abundance (patch area and basal area) along reaches with intermittent stream flows (caused by natural and cultural factors), as well as those with dam-regulated flows. Main conclusions Stream-flow regimes are strong determinants of riparian vegetation structure, and hydrological alterations can drive dominance shifts to introduced species that have an adaptive suite of traits. Deep alluvial groundwater on intermittent rivers favours the deep-rooted, stress-adapted Tamarix over the shallower-rooted and more competitive Populus and Salix. On flow-regulated rivers, shifts in flood timing favour the reproductively opportunistic Tamarix over Populus and Salix, both of which have narrow germination windows. The prevailing hydrological conditions thus favour a new dominant pioneer species in the riparian corridors of the American Southwest. These results reaffirm the importance of reinstating stream-flow regimes (inclusive of groundwater flows) for re-establishing the native pioneer trees as the dominant forest type.","Altered stream-flow regimes and invasive plant species: the Tamarix case [SEP] Aim To test the hypothesis that anthropogenic alteration of stream-flow regimes is a key driver of compositional shifts from native to introduced riparian plant species.

"Species introductions, diversity and disturbances in marine macrophyte assemblages of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea","In the process of species introduction, the traits that enable a species to establish and spread in a new habitat, and the habitat characteristics that determine the susceptibility to introduced species play a major role. Among the habitat characteristics that render a habitat resistant or susceptible to introductions, species diversity and disturbance are believed to be the most important, It is generally assumed that high species richness renders a habitat resistant to introductions, while disturbances enhance their susceptibility. In the present study, these 2 hypotheses were tested on NW Mediterranean shallow subtidal macrophyte assemblages. Data collection was carried out in early summer 2002 on sub-horizontal rocky substrate at 9 sites along the French Mediterranean coast, 4 undisturbed and 5 highly disturbed. Disturbances include cargo, naval and passenger harbours, and industrial and urban pollution. Relationships between species richness (point diversity), disturbances and the number of introduced macrophytes were analysed. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) there is no relationship between species introductions, diversity and disturbance for the macrophyte assemblages; (2) multifactorial analyses only revealed the biogeographical relationships between the native flora of the sites.","Species introductions, diversity and disturbances in marine macrophyte assemblages of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea [SEP] In the process of species introduction, the traits that enable a species to establish and spread in a new habitat, and the habitat characteristics that determine the susceptibility to introduced species play a major role.

Resource availability and invasibility in an intertidal macroalgal assemblage,"The invasibility of a low intertidal macroalgal assemblage was experimentally tested from March 2003 to April 2004 at 1 locality in northern Spain. It was hypothesised that a community becomes more susceptible to invasion when there is an increase in the amount of key resources. A bifactorial ('nutrient supply' and 'macroalgal biomass removed') orthogonal experiment was designed with 3 levels in each factor (high, medium and control). Fertile plants of Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt were transplanted to each plot to simulate the arrival of an invader. The invasibility of the assemblage was quantified in the pre- (density of recruits) and post-settlement (percentage cover, size and density of S. muticum at the end of the experiment) phases of S. muticum's life cycle. Results supported the initial hypothesis. Both space availability and nutrient enrichment facilitated the establishment and spread of S. muticum in the experimental plots. Established S. muticum plants grew faster in enriched plots than in controls. Furthermore, different successional assemblages played different roles in resisting invasion as S. muticum's life cycle progressed. In the initial stage of the invasion, the Bifurcaria bifurcata canopy inhibited recruitment by S. muticum, whereas understory species did not have a significant effect on invasion success. In contrast, an increased survivorship of S. muticum beneath the canopy of B. bifurcata was observed in those plots where S. muticum had successfully recruited. This study shows that the invasibility of this low intertidal assemblage is mediated by a complex interaction of several resources acting at different stages during S. muticum's invasion.","Resource availability and invasibility in an intertidal macroalgal assemblage [SEP] The invasibility of a low intertidal macroalgal assemblage was experimentally tested from March 2003 to April 2004 at 1 locality in northern Spain.

This successional gradient was embedded in an urban landscape near Montreal, Quebec. We predicted that diversity in young forests and old fields would be higher than in agricultural fields and old forests. Fifty-five species (2932 individuals) were found in 2003 and 46 species (2207 individuals) in 2004. In both years, species richness was highest from traps placed in agricultural fields. We collected nine introduced species; these had higher catch rates than the native species in both years (64.8% of total catch). When introduced species were removed from the Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling ordination analysis, the assemblages from agricultural fields were less distinct compared to those of the other habitats, suggesting the introduced fauna is important in structuring carabid assemblages from the agricultural fields.

Big and aerial invaders: dominance of exotic spiders in burned New Zealand tussock grasslands,"As post-disturbance community response depends on the characteristics of the ecosystem and the species composition, so does the invasion of exotic species rely on their suitability to the new environment. Here, we test two hypotheses: exotic spider species dominate the community after burning; and two traits are prevalent for their colonisation ability: ballooning and body size, the latter being correlated with their dispersal ability. We established spring burn, summer burn and unburned experimental plots in a New Zealand tussock grassland area and collected annual samples 3 and 4 years before and after the burning, respectively. Exotic spider abundance increased in the two burn treatments, driven by an increase in Linyphiidae. Indicator analysis showed that exotic and native species characterised burned and unburned plots, respectively. Generalised linear mixed-effects models indicated that ballooning had a positive effect on the post-burning establishment (density) of spiders in summer burn plots but not in spring plots. Body size had a positive effect on colonisation and establishment. The ability to balloon may partly explain the dominance of exotic Linyphiidae species. Larger spiders are better at moving into and colonising burned sites probably because of their ability to travel longer distances over land. Native species showed a low resilience to burning, and although confirmation requires longer-term data, our findings suggest that frequent fires could cause long lasting damage to the native spider fauna of tussock grasslands, and we propose limiting the use of fire to essential situations.","Big and aerial invaders: dominance of exotic spiders in burned New Zealand tussock grasslands [SEP] As post-disturbance community response depends on the characteristics of the ecosystem and the species composition, so does the invasion of exotic species rely on their suitability to the new environment.

Generalised linear mixed-effects models indicated that ballooning had a positive effect on the post-burning establishment (density) of spiders in summer burn plots but not in spring plots. Body size had a positive effect on colonisation and establishment. The ability to balloon may partly explain the dominance of exotic Linyphiidae species. Larger spiders are better at moving into and colonising burned sites probably because of their ability to travel longer distances over land. Native species showed a low resilience to burning, and although confirmation requires longer-term data, our findings suggest that frequent fires could cause long lasting damage to the native spider fauna of tussock grasslands, and we propose limiting the use of fire to essential situations.","7-0-2,7-1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Distribution Patterns and Characteristics of Plant Species by Human Impact in Urban Areas,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution patterns and characteristics of plant species by human impact in urban areas. In order to achieve a comprehensive data acquisition of all autogenously introduced vascular plant species occurring in the city of Cheon-ju, this study made an analysis of 106 sample plots, each with a size of one hectare, These sample plots were selected to represent the typical land-use patterns within the city of Cheon-ju and to cover the various distances from the city center. Species richness, patterns of life forms, and the percentage of non-native species were analyzed in relation to the degree of hemeroby of the sample plots. It was found that the species number appeared the largest in sites that were moderately influenced. This result corresponds to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis that moderate disturbance leads to an increase in species richness. The flora of sites which were subject to the highest level of human impact, was characterized by a high proportion of annual species and non-native species. In addition, some species were divided into three groups with similar distribution corresponding to land-use type and urban zone: urbanophobic (e.g. Indigofera kirilowii, Prunus sargentii, Rhus trichocarpa), urbanoneutral (e.g. Commelina communis, Erigeron annuus, Metaplexis japonica) and urbanophilus (e.g. Euphorbia supina, Senecio vulgaris, Taraxacum officinale).","Distribution Patterns and Characteristics of Plant Species by Human Impact in Urban Areas [SEP] The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution patterns and characteristics of plant species by human impact in urban areas.

"Insect herbivore faunal diversity among invasive, non-invasive and native Eugenia species: Implications for the enemy release hypothesis","The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) frequently has been invoked to explain the naturalization and spread of introduced species. One ramification of the ERH is that invasive plants sustain less herbivore pressure than do native species. Empirical studies testing the ERH have mostly involved two-way comparisons between invasive introduced plants and their native counterparts in the invaded region. Testing the ERH would be more meaningful if such studies also included introduced non-invasive species because introduced plants, regardless of their abundance or impact, may support a reduced insect herbivore fauna and experience less damage. In this study, we employed a three-way comparison, in which we compared herbivore faunas among native, introduced invasive, and introduced non-invasive plants in the genus Eugenia (Myrtaceae) which all co-occur in South Florida. We observed a total of 25 insect species in 12 families and 6 orders feeding on the six species of Eugenia. Of these insect species, the majority were native (72%), polyphagous (64%), and ectophagous (68%). We found that invasive introduced Eugenia has a similar level of herbivore richness as both the native and the non-invasive introduced Eugenia. However, the numbers and percentages of oligophagous insect species were greatest on the native Eugenia, but they were not different between the invasive and non-invasive introduced Eugenia. One oligophagous endophagous insect has likely shifted from the native to the invasive, but none to the non-invasive Eugenia. In summary, the invasive Eugenia encountered equal, if not greater, herbivore pressure than the non-invasive Eugenia, including from oligophagous and endophagous herbivores. Our data only provided limited support to the ERH. We would not have been able to draw this conclusion without inclusion of the non-invasive Eugenia species in the study.","Insect herbivore faunal diversity among invasive, non-invasive and native Eugenia species: Implications for the enemy release hypothesis [SEP] The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) frequently has been invoked to explain the naturalization and spread of introduced species.

Variable effects of large mammal herbivory on three non-native versus three native woody plants,"(1) The enemy release hypothesis posits that introduced species leave behind co-evolved pathogens and predators, thereby gaining an advantage over native competitors. On the other hand, introduced plants may encounter biotic resistance from local generalist herbivores such as large mammals. (2) We conducted a replicated, manipulative field experiment to compare the effects of large-mammal herbivory on growth and survival of three native and three invasive woody species over 2 years. Non-native Acer platanoides, Frangula alnus P Mill. (=Rhamnus frangula L.) and Elaeagnus umbellata were each paired with a likely native competitor of similar life form and shade tolerance. Seedlings were planted with and without large-mammal exclosures, in open and understory environments. (3) In the open, E. umbellata grew taller than its paired native only when exposed to herbivory, but E alnus grew taller than its paired native only within exclosures. The effects of exclosure on growth rate did not differ between A. platanoides and its native congener. In the understory, exposure to browsing reduced height growth rate overall in native species, but not in invasive species. (4) Browsing increased understory mortality only in the native shrub Viburnum dentatum, and did not affect mortality in the open. Within exclosures, there was a general trade-off between open growth and understory survival, but outside of exclosures, E. umbellata exhibited both greater open growth and greater understory survival than its native competitor. (5) Although large-mammal herbivory did not consistently favor non-natives, lack of browsing impact played an important facilitating role for E. umbellata in particular. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Natural selection on plant resistance to herbivores in the native and introduced range,"When plants are introduced into new regions, the absence of their co-evolved natural enemies can result in lower levels of attack. As a consequence of this reduction in enemy pressure, plant performance may increase and selection for resistance to enemiesmay decrease. In the present study, we compared leaf damage, plant size and leaf trichome density, as well as the direction and magnitude of selection on resistance and plant size between non-native (Spain) and native (Mexico) populations of Datura stramonium. This species was introduced to Spain about five centuries ago and constitutes an ideal system to test four predictions of the enemy release hypothesis. Compared with native populations, we expected Spanish populations of D. stramonium to have (i) lower levels of foliar damage; (ii) larger plant size; (iii) lower leaf trichome density that is unrelated to foliar damage by herbivores; and (iv) weak or no selection on resistance to herbivores but strong selection on plant size. Our results showed that, on average, plants from non-native populations were significantly less damaged by herbivores, were less pubescent and were larger than those from native populations. We also detected different selection regimes on resistance and plant size between the non-native and native ranges. Positive selection on plant size was detected in both ranges (though it was higher in the non-native area), but consistent positive selection on relative resistance was detected only in the native range. Overall, we suggest that changes in selection pressure on resistance and plant size in D. stramonium in Spain are a consequence of 'release from natural enemies'.","Natural selection on plant resistance to herbivores in the native and introduced range [SEP] When plants are introduced into new regions, the absence of their co-evolved natural enemies can result in lower levels of attack.

Plant-soil feedback induces shifts in biomass allocation in the invasive plant Chromolaena odorata,"P> Soil communities and their interactions with plants may play a major role in determining the success of invasive species. However, rigorous investigations of this idea using cross-continental comparisons, including native and invasive plant populations, are still scarce. We investigated if interactions with the soil community affect the growth and biomass allocation of the (sub)tropical invasive shrub Chromolaena odorata. We performed a cross-continental comparison with both native and non-native-range soil and native and non-native-range plant populations in two glasshouse experiments. Results are interpreted in the light of three prominent hypotheses that explain the dominance of invasive plants in the non-native range: the enemy release hypothesis, the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis and the accumulation of local pathogens hypothesis. Our results show that C. odorata performed significantly better when grown in soil pre-cultured by a plant species other than C. odorata. Soil communities from the native and non-native ranges did not differ in their effect on C. odorata performance. However, soil origin had a significant effect on plant allocation responses. Non-native C. odorata plants increased relative allocation to stem biomass and height growth when confronted with soil communities from the non-native range. This is a plastic response that may allow species to be more successful when competing for light. This response differed between native and non-native-range populations, suggesting that selection may have taken place during the process of invasion. Whether this plastic response to soil organisms will indeed select for increased competitive ability needs further study. The native grass Panicum maximum did not perform worse when grown in soil pre-cultured by C. odorata. Therefore, our results did not support the accumulation of local pathogens hypothesis. Synthesis. Non-native C. odorata did not show release from soil-borne enemies compared to its native range. However, non-native plants responded to soil biota from the non-native range by enhanced allocation in stem biomass and height growth. This response can affect the competitive balance between native and invasive species. The evolutionary potential of this soil biota-induced change in plant biomass allocation needs further study.","Plant-soil feedback induces shifts in biomass allocation in the invasive plant Chromolaena odorata [SEP] P> Soil communities and their interactions with plants may play a major role in determining the success of invasive species.

Role of plant enemies in the forestry of indigenous vs. nonindigenous pines,"Plantations of rapidly growing trees are becoming increasingly common because the high productivity can enhance local economies, support improvements in educational systems, and generally improve the quality of life in rural communities. Landowners frequently choose to plant nonindigenous species; one rationalization has been that silvicultural productivity is enhanced when trees are separated from their native herbivores and pathogens. The expectation of enemy reduction in nonindigenous species has theoretical and empirical support from studies of the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) in the context of invasion ecology, but its relevance to forestry has not been evaluated. We evaluated ERH in the productive forests of Galicia, Spain, where there has been a profusion of pine plantations, some with the indigenous Pinus pinaster, but increasingly with the nonindigenous P. radiata. Here, one of the most important pests of pines is the indigenous bark beetle, Tomicus piniperda. In support of ERH, attacks by T. piniperda were more than twice as great in stands of P. pinaster compared to P. radiata. This differential held across a range of tree ages and beetle abundance. However, this extension of ERH to forestry failed in the broader sense because beetle attacks, although fewer on P. radiata, reduced productivity of P. radiata more than that of P. pinaster ( probably because more photosynthetic tissue is lost per beetle attack in P. radiata). Productivity of the nonindigenous pine was further reduced by the pathogen, Sphaeropsis sapinea, which infected up to 28% of P. radiata but was absent in P. pinaster. This was consistent with the forestry axiom ( antithetical to ERH) that trees planted `` off- site'' are more susceptible to pathogens. Fungal infections were positively correlated with beetle attacks; apparently T. piniperda facilitates S. sapinea infections by creating wounds and by carrying fungal propagules. A globally important component in the diminution of indigenous. ora has been the deliberate large- scale propagation of nonnative trees for silviculture. At least for Pinus forestry in Spain, reduced losses to pests did not rationalize the planting of nonindigenous trees. There would be value in further exploration of relations between invasion ecology and the forestry of nonindigenous trees.","Role of plant enemies in the forestry of indigenous vs. nonindigenous pines [SEP] Plantations of rapidly growing trees are becoming increasingly common because the high productivity can enhance local economies, support improvements in educational systems, and generally improve the quality of life in rural communities.

Arthropod Communities on Native and Nonnative Early Successional Plants,"Early successional ruderal plants in North America include numerous native and nonnative species, and both are abundant in disturbed areas. The increasing presence of nonnative plants may negatively impact a critical component of food web function if these species support fewer or a less diverse arthropod fauna than the native plant species that they displace. We compared arthropod communities on six species of common early successional native plants and six species of nonnative plants, planted in replicated native and nonnative plots in a farm field. Samples were taken twice each year for 2 yr. In most arthropod samples, total biomass and abundance were substantially higher on the native plants than on the nonnative plants. Native plants produced as much as five times more total arthropod biomass and up to seven times more species per 100 g of dry leaf biomass than nonnative plants. Both herbivores and natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) predominated on native plants when analyzed separately. In addition, species richness was about three times greater on native than on nonnative plants, with 83 species of insects collected exclusively from native plants, and only eight species present only on nonnatives. These results support a growing body of evidence suggesting that nonnative plants support fewer arthropods than native plants, and therefore contribute to reduced food resources for higher trophic levels.","Arthropod Communities on Native and Nonnative Early Successional Plants [SEP] Early successional ruderal plants in North America include numerous native and nonnative species, and both are abundant in disturbed areas.

"The effects of disturbance and enemy exclusion on performance of an invasive species, common ragweed, in its native range","Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is an abundant weed in its native North America, despite supporting a wide range of natural enemies. Here, we tested whether these enemies have significant impacts on the performance of this plant in its native range. We excluded enemies from the three principal life-history stages (seed, seedling, and adult) of this annual in a series of field experiments; at the adult stage, we also manipulated soil disturbance and conspecific density. We then measured the consequences of these treatments for growth, survival, and reproduction. Excluding fungi and vertebrate granivores from seeds on the soil surface did not increase germination relative to control plots. Seedling survivorship was only slightly increased by the exclusion of molluscs and other herbivores. Insecticide reduced damage to leaves of adult plants, but did not improve growth or reproduction. Growth and survivorship of adults were strongly increased by disturbance, while higher conspecific density reduced performance in disturbed plots. These results indicate ragweed is insensitive to attack by many of its natural enemies, helping to explain its native-range success. In addition, they suggest that even though ragweed lost most of its insect folivores while invading Europe, escape from these enemies is unlikely to have provided a significant demographic advantage; instead, disturbance is likely to have been a much more important factor in its invasion. Escape from enemies should not be assumed to explain the success of exotic species unless improved performance also can be demonstrated; native-range studies can help achieve this goal.","The effects of disturbance and enemy exclusion on performance of an invasive species, common ragweed, in its native range [SEP] Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is an abundant weed in its native North America, despite supporting a wide range of natural enemies.

Release of invasive plants from fungal and viral pathogens,"Invasive plant species both threaten native biodiversity and are economically costly(1-5), but only a few naturalized species become pests(2,4). Here we report broad, quantitative support for two long-standing hypotheses that explain why only some naturalized species have large impacts. The enemy release hypothesis argues that invaders' impacts result from reduced natural enemy attack(2,4,6-10). The biotic resistance hypothesis argues that interactions with native species, including natural enemies, limit invaders' impacts(6-8). We tested these hypotheses for viruses and for rust, smut and powdery mildew fungi that infect 473 plant species naturalized to the United States from Europe. On average, 84% fewer fungi and 24% fewer virus species infect each plant species in its naturalized range than in its native range. In addition, invasive plant species that are more completely released from pathogens are more widely reported as harmful invaders of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Together, these results strongly support the enemy release hypothesis. Among noxious agricultural weeds, species accumulating more pathogens in their naturalized range are less widely noxious, supporting the biotic resistance hypothesis. Our results indicate that invasive plants' impacts may be a function of both release from and accumulation of natural enemies, including pathogens.","Release of invasive plants from fungal and viral pathogens [SEP] Invasive plant species both threaten native biodiversity and are economically costly(1-5), but only a few naturalized species become pests(2,4).

"Macroparasite Fauna of Alien Grey Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis): Composition, Variability and Implications for Native Species","Introduced hosts populations may benefit of an ""enemy release"" through impoverishment of parasite communities made of both few imported species and few acquired local ones. Moreover, closely related competing native hosts can be affected by acquiring introduced taxa (spillover) and by increased transmission risk of native parasites (spillback). We determined the macroparasite fauna of invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in Italy to detect any diversity loss, introduction of novel parasites or acquisition of local ones, and analysed variation in parasite burdens to identify factors that may increase transmission risk for native red squirrels (S. vulgaris). Based on 277 grey squirrels sampled from 7 populations characterised by different time scales in introduction events, we identified 7 gastro-intestinal helminths and 4 parasite arthropods. Parasite richness is lower than in grey squirrel's native range and independent from introduction time lags. The most common parasites are Nearctic nematodes Strongyloides robustus (prevalence: 56.6%) and Trichostrongylus calcaratus (6.5%), red squirrel flea Ceratophyllus sciurorum (26.0%) and Holarctic sucking louse Neohaematopinus sciuri (17.7%). All other parasites are European or cosmopolitan species with prevalence below 5%. S. robustus abundance is positively affected by host density and body mass, C. sciurorum abundance increases with host density and varies with seasons.

Moreover, closely related competing native hosts can be affected by acquiring introduced taxa (spillover) and by increased transmission risk of native parasites (spillback). We determined the macroparasite fauna of invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in Italy to detect any diversity loss, introduction of novel parasites or acquisition of local ones, and analysed variation in parasite burdens to identify factors that may increase transmission risk for native red squirrels (S. vulgaris). Based on 277 grey squirrels sampled from 7 populations characterised by different time scales in introduction events, we identified 7 gastro-intestinal helminths and 4 parasite arthropods. Parasite richness is lower than in grey squirrel's native range and independent from introduction time lags. The most common parasites are Nearctic nematodes Strongyloides robustus (prevalence: 56.6%) and Trichostrongylus calcaratus (6.5%), red squirrel flea Ceratophyllus sciurorum (26.0%) and Holarctic sucking louse Neohaematopinus sciuri (17.7%). All other parasites are European or cosmopolitan species with prevalence below 5%.

Grassland fires may favor native over introduced plants by reducing pathogen loads,"Grasslands have been lost and degraded in the United States since Euro-American settlement due to agriculture, development, introduced invasive species, and changes in fire regimes. Fire is frequently used in prairie restoration to control invasion by trees and shrubs, but may have additional consequences. For example, fire might reduce damage by herbivore and pathogen enemies by eliminating litter, which harbors eggs and spores. Less obviously, fire might influence enemy loads differently for native and introduced plant hosts. We used a controlled burn in a Willamette Valley (Oregon) prairie to examine these questions. We expected that, without fire, introduced host plants should have less damage than native host plants because the introduced species are likely to have left many of their enemies behind when they were transported to their new range (the enemy release hypothesis, or ERH). If the ERH holds, then fire, which should temporarily reduce enemies on all species, should give an advantage to the natives because they should see greater total reduction in damage by enemies. Prior to the burn, we censused herbivore and pathogen attack on eight plant species (five of nonnative origin: Bromus hordaceous, Cynosuros echinatus, Galium divaricatum, Schedonorus arundinaceus (=Festuca arundinacea), and Sherardia arvensis; and three natives: Danthonia californica, Epilobium minutum, and Lomatium nudicale). The same plots were monitored for two years post-fire. Prior to the burn, native plants had more kinds of damage and more pathogen damage than introduced plants, consistent with the ERH. Fire reduced pathogen damage relative to the controls more for the native than the introduced species, but the effects on herbivory were negligible. Pathogen attack was correlated with plant reproductive fitness, whereas herbivory was not. These results suggest that fire may be useful for promoting some native plants in prairies due to its negative effects on their pathogens.","Grassland fires may favor native over introduced plants by reducing pathogen loads [SEP] Grasslands have been lost and degraded in the United States since Euro-American settlement due to agriculture, development, introduced invasive species, and changes in fire regimes.

Influence of insects and fungal pathogens on individual and population parameters of Cirsium arvense in its native and introduced ranges,"Introduced weeds are hypothesized to be invasive in their exotic ranges due to release from natural enemies. Cirsium arvense (Californian, Canada, or creeping thistle) is a weed of Eurasian origin that was inadvertently introduced to New Zealand (NZ), where it is presently one of the worst invasive weeds. We tested the 'enemy release hypothesis' (ERH) by establishing natural enemy exclusion plots in both the native (Europe) and introduced (NZ) ranges of C. arvense. We followed the development and fate of individually labelled shoots and recorded recruitment of new shoots into the population over two years. Natural enemy exclusion hadminimal impact on shoot height and relative growth rate in either range. However, natural enemies did have a significant effect on shoot population growth and development in the native range, supporting the ERH. In year one, exclusion of insect herbivores increased mean population growth by 2.1-3.6 shoots m(-2), and in year two exclusion of pathogens increased mean population growth by 2.7-4.1 shoots m(-2). Exclusion of insect herbivores in the native range also increased the probability of shoots developing from the budding to the reproductive growth stage by 4.0x in the first year, and 13.4x in the second year; but exclusion of pathogens had no effect on shoot development in either year. In accordance with the ERH, exclusion of insect herbivores and pathogens did not benefit shoot development or population growth in the introduced range. In either range, we found no evidence for an additive benefit of dual exclusion of insects and pathogens, and in no case was there an interaction between insect and pathogen exclusion. This study further demonstrates the value of conducting manipulative experiments in the native and introduced ranges of an invasive plant to elucidate invasion mechanisms.","Influence of insects and fungal pathogens on individual and population parameters of Cirsium arvense in its native and introduced ranges [SEP] Introduced weeds are hypothesized to be invasive in their exotic ranges due to release from natural enemies.

Exotic Lonicera species both escape and resist specialist and generalist herbivores in the introduced range in North America,"The enemy release hypothesis predicts that invasive plant species may benefit from a lack of top-down control by co-evolved herbivores, particularly specialists, in their new range. However, to benefit from enemy escape, invasive plants must also escape or resist specialist or generalist herbivores that attack related species in the introduced range. We compared insect herbivore damage on the exotic shrub, Lonicera maackii, the native congener Lonicera reticulata, and the native confamilial Viburnum prunifolium in North America. We also compared the laboratory preference and performance of a North American honeysuckle specialist sawfly (Zaraea inflata) and the performance of a widespread generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera frugiperda) on cut foliage from native and exotic Lonicera species. L. maackii received significantly lower amounts of foliar herbivory than L. reticulata across three seasons, while damage levels observed on V. prunifolium for two seasons was generally intermediate between L. reticulata and L. maackii. The specialist sawfly damaged L. reticulata heavily, but was not detected on L. maackii in the field. There were few statistical differences in the performance of sawfly larvae on L. reticulata and L. maackii, but the sawfly achieved higher pupal masses on L. reticulata than on L. maackii, and they strongly preferred L. reticulata over L. maackii when given a choice. The sawfly was unable to complete development on native L. sempervirens and non-native L. japonica. In contrast, the generalist caterpillar performed similarly on all Lonicera species. While L. maackii experienced little herbivory in the field compared to native relatives in the same habitat, laboratory assays indicate L. maackii appears to be a suitable host that escapes selection by the specialist, but L. japonica and L. sempervirens are highly resistant to it. These findings indicate that both enemy escape and resistance (to a specialist, but not a generalist herbivore) may contribute to the success of exotic Lonicera species.","Exotic Lonicera species both escape and resist specialist and generalist herbivores in the introduced range in North America [SEP] The enemy release hypothesis predicts that invasive plant species may benefit from a lack of top-down control by co-evolved herbivores, particularly specialists, in their new range.

Enemy release and plant invasion: patterns of defensive traits and leaf damage in Hawaii,"Invasive species may be released from consumption by their native herbivores in novel habitats and thereby experience higher fitness relative to native species. However, few studies have examined release from herbivory as a mechanism of invasion in oceanic island systems, which have experienced particularly high loss of native species due to the invasion of non-native animal and plant species. We surveyed putative defensive traits and leaf damage rates in 19 pairs of taxonomically related invasive and native species in Hawaii, representing a broad taxonomic diversity. Leaf damage by insects and pathogens was monitored in both wet and dry seasons. We found that native species had higher leaf damage rates than invasive species, but only during the dry season. However, damage rates across native and invasive species averaged only 2% of leaf area. Native species generally displayed high levels of structural defense (leaf toughness and leaf thickness, but not leaf trichome density) while native and invasive species displayed similar levels of chemical defenses (total phenolics). A defense index, which integrated all putative defense traits, was significantly higher for native species, suggesting that native species may allocate fewer resources to growth and reproduction than do invasive species. Thus, our data support the idea that invasive species allocate fewer resources to defense traits, allowing them to outperform native species through increased growth and reproduction. While strong impacts of herbivores on invasion are not supported by the low damage rates we observed on mature plants, population-level studies that monitor how herbivores influence recruitment, mortality, and competitive outcomes are needed to accurately address how herbivores influence invasion in Hawaii.","Enemy release and plant invasion: patterns of defensive traits and leaf damage in Hawaii [SEP] Invasive species may be released from consumption by their native herbivores in novel habitats and thereby experience higher fitness relative to native species.

Community structure of insect herbivores on introduced and native Solidago plants in Japan,"We compared community composition, density, and species richness of herbivorous insects on the introduced plant Solidago altissima L. (Asteraceae) and the related native species Solidago virgaurea L. in Japan. We found large differences in community composition on the two Solidago species. Five hemipteran sap feeders were found only on S. altissima. Two of them, the aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum Olive (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the scale insect Parasaissetia nigra Nietner (Hemiptera: Coccidae), were exotic species, accounting for 62% of the total individuals on S. altissima. These exotic sap feeders mostly determined the difference of community composition on the two plant species. In contrast, the herbivore community on S. virgaurea consisted predominately of five native insects: two lepidopteran leaf chewers and three dipteran leaf miners. Overall species richness did not differ between the plants because the increased species richness of sap feeders was offset by the decreased richness of leaf chewers and leaf miners on S. altissima. The overall density of herbivorous insects was higher on S. altissima than on S. virgaurea, because of the high density of the two exotic sap feeding species on S. altissima. We discuss the importance of analyzing community composition in terms of feeding guilds of insect herbivores for understanding how communities of insect herbivores are organized on introduced plants in novel habitats.","Community structure of insect herbivores on introduced and native Solidago plants in Japan [SEP] We compared community composition, density, and species richness of herbivorous insects on the introduced plant Solidago altissima L.

"Island invasion by a threatened tree species: evidence for natural enemy release of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) on Dominica, Lesser Antilles","Despite its appeal to explain plant invasions, the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) remains largely unexplored for tropical forest trees. Even scarcer are ERH studies conducted on the same host species at both the community and biogeographical scale, irrespective of the system or plant life form. In Cabrits National Park, Dominica, we observed patterns consistent with enemy release of two introduced, congeneric mahogany species, Swietenia macrophylla and S. mahagoni, planted almost 50 years ago. Swietenia populations at Cabrits have reproduced, with S. macrophylla juveniles established in and out of plantation areas at densities much higher than observed in its native range. Swietenia macrophylla juveniles also experienced significantly lower leaf-level herbivory (similar to 3.0%) than nine co-occurring species native to Dominica (8.4-21.8%), and far lower than conspecific herbivory observed in its native range (11%-43%, on average). These complimentary findings at multiple scales support ERH, and confirm that Swietenia has naturalized at Cabrits. However, Swietenia abundance was positively correlated with native plant diversity at the seedling stage, and only marginally negatively correlated with native plant abundance for stems >= 1-cm dbh. Taken together, these descriptive patterns point to relaxed enemy pressure from specialized enemies, specifically the defoliator Steniscadia poliophaea and the shoot-borer Hypsipyla grandella, as a leading explanation for the enhanced recruitment of Swietenia trees documented at Cabrits.","Island invasion by a threatened tree species: evidence for natural enemy release of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) on Dominica, Lesser Antilles [SEP] Despite its appeal to explain plant invasions, the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) remains largely unexplored for tropical forest trees.

Foliar herbivory and its effects on plant growth in native and exotic species in the Patagonian steppe,"Studies of herbivory and its consequences on the growth of native and exotic plants could help elucidate some processes involved in plant invasions. Introduced species are likely to experience reduced herbivory in their new range due to the absence of specialist enemies and, thus, may have higher benefits if they reduce the investment in resistance and increase their compensatory capacity. In order to evaluate the role of herbivory in disturbed areas within the Patagonian steppe, we quantified and compared the leaf levels of herbivory of four native and five exotic species and recorded the associated insect fauna. We also performed greenhouse experiments in which we simulated herbivory in order to evaluate the compensatory capacity of native and exotic species under different herbivory levels that resembled naturally occurring damage. Natural herbivory levels in the field were similar between the studied exotic and native plants. Field observations confirmed that they both shared some herbivore insects, most of which are generalists. In the greenhouse experiments, both exotic and native plants fully compensated for herbivory. Our results suggest that the studied exotic plants are not released from herbivory in the Patagonian steppe but are able to fully compensate for it. The capacity to recover from herbivory coupled with other potential adaptations, such as a better performance under disturbance and greater competitive ability than that of the native species, may represent some of the mechanisms responsible for the success of plant invasion in the Patagonian steppe.","Foliar herbivory and its effects on plant growth in native and exotic species in the Patagonian steppe [SEP] Studies of herbivory and its consequences on the growth of native and exotic plants could help elucidate some processes involved in plant invasions.

Herbivory and the success of Ligustrum lucidum: evidence from a comparison between native and novel ranges,"Invasive plant species may benefit from a reduction in herbivory in their introduced range. The reduced herbivory may cause a reallocation of resources from defence to fitness. Here, we evaluated leaf herbivory of an invasive tree species (Ligustrum lucidum Aiton) in its native and novel ranges, and determined the potential changes in leaf traits that may be associated with the patterns of herbivory. We measured forest structure, damage by herbivores and leaf traits in novel and native ranges, and on the basis of the literature, we identified the common natural herbivores of L. lucidum. We also performed an experiment offering leaves from both ranges to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera frugiperda). L. lucidum was more abundant and experienced significantly less foliar damage in the novel than in the native range, in spite of the occurrence of several natural herbivores. The reduced lignin content and lower lignin : N ratio in novel leaves, together with the higher herbivore preference for leaves of this origin in the laboratory experiment, indicated lower herbivore resistance in novel than in native populations. The reduced damage by herbivores is not the only factor explaining invasion success, but it may be an important cause that enhances the invasiveness of L. lucidum.","Herbivory and the success of Ligustrum lucidum: evidence from a comparison between native and novel ranges [SEP] Invasive plant species may benefit from a reduction in herbivory in their introduced range.

"Impact of fire on leaf nutrients, arthropod fauna and herbivory of native and exotic eucalypts in Kings Park, Perth, Western Australia","The vegetation of Kings Park, near the centre of Perth, Western Australia, once had an overstorey of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart), and many trees still remain in the bushland parts of the Park. Avenues and roadsides have been planted with eastern Australian species, including Eucalyptus cladocalyx (sugar gum) and Eucalyptus botryoides (southern mahogany), both of which have become invasive. The present study examined the effect of a recent burn on the level of herbivory on these native and exotic eucalypts. Leaf damage, shoot extension and number of new leaves were measured on tagged shoots of saplings of each tree species in unburnt and burnt areas over an 8-month period. Leaf macronutrient levels were quantified and the number of arthropods on saplings was measured at the end of the recording period by chemical knockdown. Leaf macronutrients were mostly higher in all four species in the burnt area, and this was associated with generally higher numbers of canopy arthropods and greater levels of leaf damage. It is suggested that the pulse of soil nutrients after the fire resulted in more nutrient-rich foliage, which in turn was more palatable to arthropods. The resulting high levels of herbivory possibly led to reduced shoot extension of E. gomphocephala, E. botryoides and, to a lesser extent, E. cladocalyx. This acts as a negative feedback mechanism that lessens the tendency for lush, post-fire regrowth to outcompete other species of plants. There was no consistent difference in the levels of the various types of leaf damage or of arthropods on the native and the exotic eucalypts, suggesting that freedom from herbivory is not contributing to the invasiveness of the two exotic species.","Impact of fire on leaf nutrients, arthropod fauna and herbivory of native and exotic eucalypts in Kings Park, Perth, Western Australia [SEP] The vegetation of Kings Park, near the centre of Perth, Western Australia, once had an overstorey of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart), and many trees still remain in the bushland parts of the Park.

Enemy release but no evolutionary loss of defence in a plant invasion: an inter-continental reciprocal transplant experiment,"When invading new regions exotic species may escape from some of their natural enemies. Reduced top-down control (""enemy release"") following this escape is often invoked to explain demographic expansion of invasive species and also may alter the selective regime for invasive species: reduced damage can allow resources previously allocated to defence to be reallocated to other functions like growth and reproduction. This reallocation may provide invaders with an ""evolution of increased competitive ability"" over natives that defend themselves against specialist enemies. We tested for enemy release and the evolution of increased competitive ability in the North American native ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifblia: Asteraceae), which currently is invading France. We found evidence of enemy release in natural field populations from the invaded and native ranges. Further we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment, comparing several life history traits of plants from two North American (Ontario and South Carolina) and one French population in four common gardens on both continents. French and Canadian plants had similar flowering phenologies, flowering earlier than plants from further south in the native range. This may suggest that invasive French plants originated from similar latitudes to the Canadian population sampled. As with natural populations, experimental plants suffered far less herbivore damage in France than in Ontario. This difference in herbivory translated into increased growth but not into increased size or vigour. Moreover, we found that native genotypes were as damaged as invading ones in all experimental sites, suggesting no evolutionary loss of defence against herbivores.","Enemy release but no evolutionary loss of defence in a plant invasion: an inter-continental reciprocal transplant experiment [SEP] When invading new regions exotic species may escape from some of their natural enemies. Reduced top-down control (""enemy release"") following this escape is often invoked to explain demographic expansion of invasive species and also may alter the selective regime for invasive species: reduced damage can allow resources previously allocated to defence to be reallocated to other functions like growth and reproduction. This reallocation may provide invaders with an ""evolution of increased competitive ability"" over natives that defend themselves against specialist enemies. We tested for enemy release and the evolution of increased competitive ability in the North American native ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifblia: Asteraceae), which currently is invading France. We found evidence of enemy release in natural field populations from the invaded and native ranges. Further we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment, comparing several life history traits of plants from two North American (Ontario and South Carolina) and one French population in four common gardens on both continents. French and Canadian plants had similar flowering phenologies, flowering earlier than plants from further south in the native range. This may suggest that invasive French plants originated from similar latitudes to the Canadian population sampled. As with natural populations, experimental plants suffered far less herbivore damage in France than in Ontario. This difference in herbivory translated into increased growth but not into increased size or vigour.

Herbivores and the success of exotic plants: a phylogenetically controlled experiment,"ln a field experiment with 30 locally occurring old-field plant species grown in a common garden, we found that non-native plants suffer levels of attack (leaf herbivory) equal to or greater than levels suffered by congeneric native plants. This phylogenetically controlled analysis is in striking contrast to the recent findings from surveys of exotic organisms, and suggests that even if 'enemy release' does accompany the invasion this may not be an important mechanism of invasion, particularly for plants with process, close relatives in the recipient flora.","Herbivores and the success of exotic plants: a phylogenetically controlled experiment [SEP] ln a field experiment with 30 locally occurring old-field plant species grown in a common garden, we found that non-native plants suffer levels of attack (leaf herbivory) equal to or greater than levels suffered by congeneric native plants.

"Insect assemblages associated with the exotic riparian shrub Russian olive (Elaeagnaceae), and co-occurring native shrubs in British Columbia, Canada","Russian olive ( Elaeagnus angustifolia Linnaeus; Elaeagnaceae) is an exotic shrub/tree that has become invasive in many riparian ecosystems throughout semi-arid, western North America, including southern British Columbia, Canada. Despite its prevalence and the potentially dramatic impacts it can have on riparian and aquatic ecosystems, little is known about the insect communities associated with Russian olive within its invaded range. At six sites throughout the Okanagan valley of southern British Columbia, Canada, we compared the diversity of insects associated with Russian olive plants to that of insects associated with two commonly co-occurring native plant species: Woods' rose ( Rosa woodsii Lindley; Rosaceae) and Saskatoon ( Amelanchier alnifolia (Nuttall) Nuttall ex Roemer; Rosaceae). Total abundance did not differ significantly among plant types. Family richness and Shannon diversity differed significantly between Woods' rose and Saskatoon, but not between either of these plant types and Russian olive. An abundance of Thripidae (Thysanoptera) on Russian olive and Tingidae (Hemiptera) on Saskatoon contributed to significant compositional differences among plant types. The families Chloropidae (Diptera), Heleomyzidae (Diptera), and Gryllidae (Orthoptera) were uniquely associated with Russian olive, albeit in low abundances.

Influence of two exotic earthworm species with different foraging strategies on abundance and composition of boreal microarthropods,"In North America, many species of European earthworms have been introduced to northern forests. Facilitative or competitive interactions between these earthworm species may result in non-additive effects on native plant and animal species. We investigated the combined versus individual effects of the litter-dwelling earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra Savigny, 1826 and the deep-burrowing species Lumbricus terrestris L, 1758 on microarthropod assemblages from boreal forest soil by conducting a mesocosm experiment. Soil cores from earthworm-free areas of northern Alberta, Canada, were inoculated with D. octaedra alone, L terrestris alone, both worm species together, or no earthworms. After 4.5 months, microarthropods were extracted from the soil, counted, and identified to higher taxa. Oribatid mites were further identified to family and genus. Abundance of microarthropods was significantly lower in the treatment containing both species than in the no earthworm treatment and the L terrestris treatment. Oribatida and Prostigmata/Astigmata differed significantly among treatments and were lowest in the treatment containing both earthworm species, followed by the D. octaedra treatment, although post-hoc pairwise comparisons were not significant. Within the Oribatida, composition differed between the control and L terrestris treatments as compared to the D. octaedra and both-species treatments, with Suctobelbella and Tectocepheus in particular having higher abundances in the control treatment. Effects of the two earthworm species on microarthropods were neither synergistic nor antagonistic. Our results indicate that earthworms can have strong effects on microarthropod assemblages in boreal forest soils. Future research should examine whether these changes have cascading effects on nutrient cycling, microbial communities, or plant growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecology of brushtail possums in New Zealand dryland ecosystem,"The introduced brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a major environmental and agricultural pest in New Zealand but little information is available on the ecology of possums in drylands, which cover c. 19% of the country. Here, we describe a temporal snapshot of the diet and feeding preferences of possums in a dryland habitat in New Zealand's South Island, as well as movement patterns and survival rates. We also briefly explore spatial patterns in capture rates. We trapped 279 possums at an average capture rate of 9 possums per 100 trap nights. Capture rates on individual trap lines varied from 0 to 38%, decreased with altitude, and were highest in the eastern (drier) parts of the study area. Stomach contents were dominated by forbs and sweet briar (Rosa rubiginosa); both items were consumed preferentially relative to availability. Possums also strongly preferred crack willow (Salix fragilis), which was uncommon in the study area and consumed only occasionally, but in large amounts. Estimated activity areas of 29 possums radio-tracked for up to 12 months varied from 0.2 to 19.5 ha (mean 5.1 ha). Nine possums (4 male, 5 female) undertook dispersal movements (>=1000 m), the longest of which was 4940 m. The most common dens of radio-collared possums were sweet briar shrubs, followed by rock outcrops. Estimated annual survival was 85% for adults and 54% for subadults. Differences between the diets, activity areas and den use of possums in this study and those in forest or farmland most likely reflect differences in availability and distribution of resources. Our results suggest that invasive willow and sweet briar may facilitate the existence of possums by providing abundant food and shelter. In turn, possums may facilitate the spread of weeds by acting as a seed vector. This basic ecological information will be useful in modelling and managing the impacts of possum populations in drylands.","Ecology of brushtail possums in New Zealand dryland ecosystem [SEP] The introduced brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a major environmental and agricultural pest in New Zealand but little information is available on the ecology of possums in drylands, which cover c. 19% of the country.

Non-native earthworms promote plant invasion by ingesting seeds and modifying soil properties,"Earthworms can have strong direct effects on plant communities through consumption and digestion of seeds, however it is unclear how earthworms may influence the relative abundance and composition of plant communities invaded by non-native species. In this study, earthworms, seed banks, and the standing vegetation were sampled in a grassland of central California. Our objectives were i) to examine whether the abundances of non-native, invasive earthworm species and non-native grassland plant species are correlated, and ii) to test whether seed ingestion by these worms alters the soil seed bank by evaluating the composition of seeds in casts relative to uningested soil. Sampling locations were selected based on historical land-use practices, including presence or absence of tilling, and revegetation by seed using Phalaris aquatica. Only non-native earthworm species were found, dominated by the invasive European species Aporrectodea trapezoides. Earthworm abundance was significantly higher in the grassland blocks dominated by non-native plant species, and these sites had higher carbon and moisture contents. Earthworm abundance was also positively related to increased emergence of non-native seedlings, but had no effect on that of native seedlings. Plant species richness and total seedling emergence were higher in casts than in uningested soils. This study suggests that there is a potential effect of non-native earthworms in promoting non-native and likely invasive plant species within grasslands, due to seed-plant-earthworm interactions via soil modification or to seed ingestion by earthworms and subsequent cast effects on grassland dynamics. This study supports a growing body of literature for earthworms as ecosystem engineers but highlights the relative importance of considering non-native-native interactions with the associated plant community.

Context- and density-dependent effects of introduced oysters on biodiversity,"Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, have been introduced throughout much of the world, become invasive in many locations and can alter native assemblage structure, biodiversity and the distribution and abundance of other species. It is not known, however, to what extent their effects on biodiversity change as their cover increases, and how these effects may differ depending on the environmental context. Experimental plots with increasing cover of oysters were established within two estuaries in two different habitats commonly inhabited by C. gigas, (mussel-beds and mud-flats) and were sampled after 4 and 15 months. Within mud-flat habitats, macroscopic species living on or in the substratum increased in richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and number of individuals with oyster cover. In mussel-bed habitats, however, these indices were unaffected by the cover of oysters except at one estuary after 15 months when species richness was significantly lower in plots with the greatest cover of oysters. Assemblage structure differed with oyster cover in mud-flats but not in mussel-beds, except at 100 % cover in one location and at one time. Within mud-flats at one location and time (of four total tests), assemblages became more homogenous with increasing cover of oysters leading to a significant decrease in beta-diversity. These responses were primarily underpinned by the facilitation of several taxa including a grazing gastropod (Littorina littorea), an invasive barnacle (Austrominius modestus) and a primary producer (Fucus vesiculosus) with increasing cover of oysters. Although there were consistent positive effects of C. gigas on mud-flat biodiversity, effects were weak or negative at higher cover on mussel-beds. This highlights the need for the impacts of invasive species to be investigated at a range of invader abundances within different environmental contexts.","Context- and density-dependent effects of introduced oysters on biodiversity [SEP] Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, have been introduced throughout much of the world, become invasive in many locations and can alter native assemblage structure, biodiversity and the distribution and abundance of other species.

"Exotic species replacement: shifting dominance of dreissenid mussels in the Soulanges Canal, upper St. Lawrence River, Canada","During the early 1990s, 2 Eurasian macrofouling mollusks, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and the quagga mussel D. bugensis, colonized the freshwater section of the St. Lawrence River and decimated native mussel populations through competitive interference. For several years, zebra mussels dominated molluscan biomass in the river; however, quagga mussels have increased in abundance and are apparently displacing zebra mussels from the Soulanges Canal, west of the Island of Montreal. The ratio of quagga mussel biomass to zebra mussel biomass on the canal wall is correlated with depth, and quagga mussels constitute > 99% of dreissenid biomass on bottom sediments. This dominance shift did not substantially affect the total dreissenid biomass, which has remained at 3 to 5 kg fresh mass /m(2) on the canal walls for nearly a decade. The mechanism for this shift is unknown, but may be related to a greater bioenergetic efficiency for quaggas, which attained larger shell sizes than zebra mussels at all depths. Similar events have occurred in the lower Great Lakes where zebra mussels once dominated littoral macroinvertebrate biomass, demonstrating that a well-established and prolific invader can be replaced by another introduced species without prior extinction.","Exotic species replacement: shifting dominance of dreissenid mussels in the Soulanges Canal, upper St. Lawrence River, Canada [SEP] During the early 1990s, 2 Eurasian macrofouling mollusks, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and the quagga mussel D. bugensis, colonized the freshwater section of the St. Lawrence River and decimated native mussel populations through competitive interference.

"Implications of beaver Castor canadensis and trout introductions on native fish in the Cape Horn biosphere reserve, Chile","Invasive species threaten global biodiversity, but multiple invasions make predicting the impacts difficult because of potential synergistic effects. We examined the impact of introduced beaver Castor canadensis, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss on native stream fishes in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile. The combined effects of introduced species on the structure of the native freshwater fish community were quantified by electrofishing 28 stream reaches within four riparian habitat types (forest, grassland, shrubland, and beaver-affected habitat) in 23 watersheds and by measuring related habitat variables (water velocity, substrate type, depth. and the percentage of pools). Three native stream fish species (puye Galaxias maculatus [also known as inanga], Aplochiton taeniatus, and A. zebra) were found along with brook trout and rainbow trout., but puye was the only native species that was common and widespread. The reaches affected by beaver impoundments had significantly higher puye densities than all other reaches in this study. These results are comparable to those reported for other streams in southern Chile. The presence of trout reduced the abundance of puye, but only in beaver-affected areas: all three natural riparian habitat types had uniformly low puye abundance and were unaffected by the presence or absence of trout. The data suggest that one invasive species, the beaver, enhanced puye habitat and thereby increased the abundance of that species, which, in turn, helped moderate the negative impacts of invasive trout.","Implications of beaver Castor canadensis and trout introductions on native fish in the Cape Horn biosphere reserve, Chile [SEP] Invasive species threaten global biodiversity, but multiple invasions make predicting the impacts difficult because of potential synergistic effects.

Cane toads on cowpats: commercial livestock production facilitates toad invasion in tropical Australia,"Habitat disturbance and the spread of invasive organisms are major threats to biodiversity, but the interactions between these two factors remain poorly understood in many systems. Grazing activities may facilitate the spread of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) through tropical Australia by providing year-round access to otherwise-seasonal resources. We quantified the cane toad's use of cowpats (feces piles) in the field, and conducted experimental trials to assess the potential role of cowpats as sources of prey, water, and warmth for toads. Our field surveys show that cane toads are found on or near cowpats more often than expected by chance. Field-enclosure experiments show that cowpats facilitate toad feeding by providing access to dung beetles. Cowpats also offer moist surfaces that can reduce dehydration rates of toads and are warmer than other nearby substrates. Livestock grazing is the primary form of land use over vast areas of Australia, and pastoral activities may have contributed substantially to the cane toad's successful invasion of that continent.","Cane toads on cowpats: commercial livestock production facilitates toad invasion in tropical Australia [SEP] Habitat disturbance and the spread of invasive organisms are major threats to biodiversity, but the interactions between these two factors remain poorly understood in many systems.

Variation in herbivore-mediated indirect effects of an invasive plant on a native plant,"Theory predicts that damage by a shared herbivore to a secondary host plant species may either be higher or lower in the vicinity of a preferred host plant species. To evaluate the importance of ecological factors, such as host plant proximity and density, in determining the direction and strength of such herbivore-mediated indirect effects, we quantified oviposition by the exotic weevil Rhinocyllus conicus on the native wavyleaf thistle Cirsium undulatum in midgrass prairie on loam soils in the upper Great Plains, USA. Over three years (2001-2003), the number of eggs laid by R. conicus on C. undulatum always decreased significantly with distance (0-220 m) from a musk thistle ( Carduus nutans L.) patch. Neither the level of R. conicus oviposition on C. undulatum nor the strength of the distance effect was predicted by local musk thistle patch density or by local C. undulatum density ( <= 5 m). The results suggest that high R. conicus egg loads on C. undulatum near musk thistle resulted from the native thistle's co-occurrence with the coevolved preferred exotic host plant and not from the weevil's response to local host plant density. Mean egg loads on C. undulatum also were greater at sites with higher R. conicus densities. We conclude that both preferred-plant proximity and shared herbivore density strongly affected the herbivore-mediated indirect interaction, suggesting that such interactions are important pathways by which invasive exotic weeds can indirectly impact native plants.","Variation in herbivore-mediated indirect effects of an invasive plant on a native plant [SEP] Theory predicts that damage by a shared herbivore to a secondary host plant species may either be higher or lower in the vicinity of a preferred host plant species.

Strong invaders are strong defenders - implications for the resistance of invaded communities,"Many ecosystems receive a steady stream of non-native species. How biotic resistance develops over time in these ecosystems will depend on how established invaders contribute to subsequent resistance. If invasion success and defence capacity (i.e. contribution to resistance) are correlated, then community resistance should increase as species accumulate. If successful invaders also cause most impact (through replacing native species with low defence capacity) then the effect will be even stronger. If successful invaders instead have weak defence capacity or even facilitative attributes, then resistance should decrease with time, as proposed by the invasional meltdown hypothesis. We analysed 1157 introductions of freshwater fish in Swedish lakes and found that species' invasion success was positively correlated with their defence capacity and impact, suggesting that these communities will develop stronger resistance over time. These insights can be used to identify scenarios where invading species are expected to cause large impact.","Strong invaders are strong defenders - implications for the resistance of invaded communities [SEP] Many ecosystems receive a steady stream of non-native species.

If successful invaders instead have weak defence capacity or even facilitative attributes, then resistance should decrease with time, as proposed by the invasional meltdown hypothesis. We analysed 1157 introductions of freshwater fish in Swedish lakes and found that species' invasion success was positively correlated with their defence capacity and impact, suggesting that these communities will develop stronger resistance over time. These insights can be used to identify scenarios where invading species are expected to cause large impact.","1,8-2-0",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Scaling the consequences of interactions between invaders from the indivdual to the population level,"The impact of human-induced stressors, such as invasive species, is often measured at the organismal level, but is much less commonly scaled up to the population level. Interactions with invasive species represent an increasingly common source of stressor in many habitats. However, due to the increasing abundance of invasive species around the globe, invasive species now commonly cause stresses not only for native species in invaded areas, but also for other invasive species. I examine the European green crab Carcinus maenas, an invasive species along the northeast coast of North America, which is known to be negatively impacted in this invaded region by interactions with the invasive Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus. Asian shore crabs are known to negatively impact green crabs via two mechanisms: by directly preying on green crab juveniles and by indirectly reducing green crab fecundity via interference (and potentially exploitative) competition that alters green crab diets. I used life-table analyses to scale these two mechanistic stressors up to the population level in order to examine their relative impacts on green crab populations. I demonstrate that lost fecundity has larger impacts on per capita population growth rates, but that both predation and lost fecundity are capable of reducing population growth sufficiently to produce the declines in green crab populations that have been observed in areas where these two species overlap. By scaling up the impacts of one invader on a second invader, I have demonstrated that multiple documented interactions between these species are capable of having population-level impacts and that both may be contributing to the decline of European green crabs in their invaded range on the east coast of North America.","Scaling the consequences of interactions between invaders from the indivdual to the population level [SEP] The impact of human-induced stressors, such as invasive species, is often measured at the organismal level, but is much less commonly scaled up to the population level.

Biological invasion into the nested assemblage of tree-beetle associations on the oceanic Ogasawara Islands,"Invasion by alien organisms is a common worldwide phenomenon, and many alien species invade native communities. Invasion by alien species is especially likely to occur on oceanic islands. To determine how alien species become integrated into island plant-insect associations, we analyzed the structure of tree-beetle associations using host plant records for larval feeding by wood-feeding beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) on the oceanic Ogasawara Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The host plant records comprised 109 associations among 28 tree (including 8 alien) and 26 cerambycid (including 5 alien) species. Of these associations, 41.3% involved at least one alien species. Most native cerambycid species feed on host trees that have recently died. Alien trees were used by as many native cerambycid species (but by significantly more alien cerambycid species) as were native trees. Native cerambycid species used as many alien tree species (but significantly more native tree species) as did alien cerambycids. Thus, we observed many types of interactions among native and alien species. A network analysis revealed a significant nested structure in tree-cerambycid associations regardless of whether alien species were excluded from the analysis. The original nested associations on the Ogasawara Islands may thus have accepted alien species.","Biological invasion into the nested assemblage of tree-beetle associations on the oceanic Ogasawara Islands [SEP] Invasion by alien organisms is a common worldwide phenomenon, and many alien species invade native communities.

Abundance and habitat preferences of the southernmost population of mink: implications for managing a recent island invasion,"Since 2001 invasive American mink has been known to populate Navarino Island, an island located in the pristine wilderness of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile, lacking native carnivorous mammals. As requested by scientists and managers, our study aims at understanding the population ecology of mink in order to respond to conservation concerns. We studied the abundance of mink in different semi-aquatic habitats using live trapping (n = 1,320 trap nights) and sign surveys (n = 68 sites). With generalized linear models we evaluated mink abundance in relation to small-scale habitat features including habitats engineered by invasive beavers (Castor canadensis). Mink have colonized the entire island and signs were found in 79% of the surveys in all types of semi-aquatic habitats. Yet, relative population abundance (0.75 mink/km of coastline) was still below densities measured in other invaded or native areas. The habitat model accuracies indicated that mink were generally less specific in habitat use, probably due to the missing limitations normally imposed by predators or competitors. The selected models predicted that mink prefer to use shrubland instead of open habitat, coastal areas with heterogeneous shores instead of flat beaches, and interestingly, that mink avoid habitats strongly modified by beavers. Our results indicate need for immediate mink control on Navarino Island. For this future management we suggest that rocky coastal shores should be considered as priority sites deserving special conservation efforts. Further research is needed with respect to the immigration of mink from adjacent islands and to examine facilitating or hampering relationships between the different invasive species present, especially if integrative management is sought.","Abundance and habitat preferences of the southernmost population of mink: implications for managing a recent island invasion [SEP] Since 2001 invasive American mink has been known to populate Navarino Island, an island located in the pristine wilderness of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile, lacking native carnivorous mammals.

Hawaiian ant-flower networks. Nectar-thieving ants prefer undefended native over introduced plants with floral defense,"Ants are omnipresent in most terrestrial ecosystems, and plants have responded to their dominance by evolving traits that either facilitate positive interactions with ants or reduce negative ones. Because ants are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis, ant-flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of antplant species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant community and local ant activity at sugar baits. As predicted, flowers of plants that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii were more strongly exploited by ants than flowers of co-occurring introduced plants, which shared an evolutionary history with ants. We also found that the percentage of plant species with ant-visited flowers was much higher in Hawaii than in other island and continental systems, even reaching 100% in habitats dominated by endemic species. We showed experimentally that the absence of ants on flowers of most introduced and few native plants species was due to morphological barriers, repellent floral scents, and to a lesser extent, unpalatable nectar. Analysis of floral volatiles, however, revealed no consistent ant-repellent ""syndrome"" attributable to negative responses by ants, probably due to the high chemical variability within the floral scent bouquets. Results from a molecular phylogeny imply that floral defenses against ants were convergently lost in native Hawaiian plants. Exploitation of floral nectar by ants may be an important threat to Hawaiian ecosystems, reducing nectar resources available to native flower visitors and potentially reducing the reproductive success of the endangered endemic flora.","Hawaiian ant-flower networks.

Co-invasion by Pinus and its mycorrhizal fungi,"P>The absence of co-evolved mutualists of plants invading a novel habitat is the logical corollary of the more widely recognized 'enemy escape'. To avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, plants may co-invade with nonnative mutualists, form novel associations with native mutualists or form associations with native cosmopolitan mutualists, which are native but not novel to the invading plant. We tested these hypotheses by contrasting the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with invasive Pinus contorta in New Zealand with co-occurring endemic Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides. Fungal communities on Pinus were species poor (14 ectomycorrhizal species) and dominated by nonnative (93%) and cosmopolitan fungi (7%). Nothofagus had a species-rich (98 species) fungal community dominated by native Cortinarius and two cosmopolitan fungi. These results support co-invasion by mutualists rather than novel associations as an important mechanism by which plants avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, consistent with invasional meltdown.","Co-invasion by Pinus and its mycorrhizal fungi [SEP] P>The absence of co-evolved mutualists of plants invading a novel habitat is the logical corollary of the more widely recognized 'enemy escape'.

Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions,"Biological invasions are rapidly producing planet-wide changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. In coastal waters of the U.S., >500 invaders have become established, and new introductions continue at an increasing rate. Although most species have little impact on native communities, some initially benign introductions may occasionally turn into damaging invasions, although such introductions are rarely documented. Here, I demonstrate that a recently introduced crab has resulted in the rapid spread and increase of an introduced bivalve that had been rare in the system for nearly 50 yr. This increase has occurred through the positive indirect effects of predation by the introduced crab on native bivalves. I used field and laboratory experiments to show that the mechanism is size-specific predation interacting with the different reproductive life histories of the native (protandrous hermaphrodite) and the introduced (dioecious) bivalves. These results suggest that positive interactions among the hundreds of introduced species that are accumulating in coastal systems could result in the rapid transformation of previously benign introductions into aggressively expanding invasions. Even if future management efforts reduce the number of new introductions, given the large number of species already present, there is a high potential for positive interactions to produce many future management problems. Given that invasional meltdown is now being documented in natural systems, I suggest that coastal systems may be closer to this threshold than currently believed.","Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions [SEP] Biological invasions are rapidly producing planet-wide changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function.

Effects of the invasive Barbary ground squirrel (Atlantoxerus getulus) on seed dispersal systems of insular xeric environments,"The interaction of native and introduced fruit consumers (especially the squirrel Atlantoxerus getulus) with native and non-native fleshy-fruited plant species was studied in the semi-desertic Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands). The ecological effect of the A. getulus squirrel was compared to that of another introduced mammal (the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus) and a native seed disperser (the lizard Gallotia atlantica). Fleshy fruits were an essential food and water resource in this xeric island. Coinciding with maximum fruit availability, consumption of native plant fruits occurred mainly in the spring while introduced plants were ingested in autumn. A significant number of Rubia fruticosa fruits were consumed by lizards, whereas squirrels ate a large amount of Lycium intricatum fruits. Asparagus pastorianus was consumed in similar quantities by each of the three fruit consumers. Fruits from Opuntia were mainly eaten by the squirrels. Lizards should be considered as legitimate seed dispersers for the three native species, while the two mammals are illegitimate dispersal agents. However, in the case of the non-native Opuntia, squirrels produce an invasional meltdown effect in the colonization of this cactus on Fuerteventura Island. While this invasive squirrel plays a significant negative predatory role on native seed plants, it is an effective disperser of some introduced plants.

"Predicting habitat use and trophic interactions of Eurasian ruffe, round gobies, and zebra mussels in nearshore areas of Great Lakes","The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to numerous introductions of nonindigenous species, including two recent benthic fish invaders, Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), as well as the benthic bivalve, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). These three exotic species, or ""exotic triad,"" may impact nearshore benthic communities due to their locally high abundances and expanding distributions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether ruffe and gobies may compete for habitat and invertebrate food in benthic environments, and (2) if zebra mussels can alter those competitive relationships by serving as an alternate food source for gobies. In laboratory mesocosms, both gobies and ruffe preferred cobble and macrophyte areas to open sand either when alone or in sympatry. In a 9-week goby-ruffe competition experiment simulating an invasion scenario with a limited food base, gobies grew faster than did ruffe, suggesting that gobies may be competitively superior at low resource levels. When zebra mussels were added in a short-term experiment, the presence or absence of mussels did not affect goby or ruffe growth, as few zebra mussels were consumed. This finding, along with other laboratory evidence, suggests that gobies may prefer soft-bodied invertebrate prey over zebra mussels. Studies of interactions among the ""exotic triad"", combined with continued surveillance, may help Great Lakes fisheries managers to predict future population sizes and distributions of these invasive fish, evaluate their impacts on native food webs, and direct possible control measures to appropriate species.","Predicting habitat use and trophic interactions of Eurasian ruffe, round gobies, and zebra mussels in nearshore areas of Great Lakes [SEP] The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to numerous introductions of nonindigenous species, including two recent benthic fish invaders, Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), as well as the benthic bivalve, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha).

The targeting of large-sized benthic macrofauna by an invasive portunid predator: evidence form a caging study,"The Portunid crab Charybdis japonica was first found in Waitemata Harbour, New Zealand, in 2000. It has established breeding populations and has been spreading, yet information on its dietary preferences in New Zealand are unknown. We conducted field caging experiments to elucidate prey choices and potential impacts of Charybdis on benthic communities. We tested the hypothesis that Charybdis would reduce the previously demonstrated positive influence of native pinnid bivalves, Atrina zelandica, on the abundance and richness of surrounding soft-sediment macrofauna. Adult male Charybdis were introduced to cages with and without Atrina that included soft-sediment macrofaunal communities of ambient composition and abundance. After leaving the crabs to feed overnight, changes in community structure (relative to sediments without crabs) were determined by coring the sediment and analysing the resident macrofauna. Prey choices were verified by extracting taxa from the stomachs of crabs collected from the cages in which they had been feeding. The abundance of large taxa including burrowing urchins, bivalves and native crabs was lower in the presence of Charybdis compared to areas without this invader. The stomach contents of Charybdis were dominated by these same three taxa, constituting 85 % of the prey abundance when using stomach fullness as a weighting factor. Our hypothesis was supported with the greatest net losses occurring in cages with Charybdis and Atrina. Reduction in the abundance of Echinocardium cordatum by Charybdis could have cascading ecological effects, as these urchins play a critical role in benthic soft-sediment ecosystems in New Zealand via bioturbation and biogenic disturbance.","The targeting of large-sized benthic macrofauna by an invasive portunid predator: evidence form a caging study [SEP] The Portunid crab Charybdis japonica was first found in Waitemata Harbour, New Zealand, in 2000.

Relationship betwen alien plants and an alien bird species on Reunion island,"Many studies have shown that plant or bird invasions can be facilitated by native species, but few have demonstrated the possibility of a positive interaction between introduced species. We analysed the relationships between four invasive alien fleshy-fruited plants, Clidemia hirta, Rubus alceifolius, Lantana camara, Schinus terebinthifolius, and an invasive alien bird, the red-whiskered bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus introduced to Reunion Island (Indian Ocean). We compared the distribution of food items in the bulbul diet according to seasons and to abundance classes of this bird. Pycnonotus jocosus is mostly frugivorous and frequently eats the main alien plants (more than 80% frequency of food items). Sites with alien species, such as Clidemia hirta, providing fruits throughout the year supported more birds than sites providing fruits, such as Schinus terebinthifolius, seasonally. The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara).","Relationship betwen alien plants and an alien bird species on Reunion island [SEP] Many studies have shown that plant or bird invasions can be facilitated by native species, but few have demonstrated the possibility of a positive interaction between introduced species.

The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara).","8-2-0,8-2-1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
An emergent multiple predator effect may enhance biotic resistance in a stream fish assemblage,"While two cyprinid fishes introduced from nearby drainages have become widespread and abundant in the Eel River of northwestern California, a third nonindigenous cyprinid has remained largely confined to less than or equal to25 km of one major tributary. (the Van Duzen River) for at least 15 years. The downstream limit of this species, speckled dace, does not appear to correspond with any thresholds or steep gradients in abiotic conditions, but it lies near the upstream limits of three other fishes: coastrange sculpin, prickly sculpin, and nonindigenous Sacramento pikeminnow. We conducted a laboratory stream experiment to explore the potential for emergent multiple predator effects to influence biotic resistance in this situation. Sculpins in combination with Sacramento pikeminnow caused greater mortality of speckled dace than predicted based on their separate effects. In contrast to speckled dace, 99% of sculpin survived trials with Sacramento pikeminnow, in part because sculpin usually occupied benthic cover units while Sacramento pikeminnow occupied the water column. A 10-fold difference in benthic cover availability did not detectably influence biotic interactions in the experiment. The distribution of speckled dace in the Eel River drainage may be limited by two predator taxa with very different patterns of habitat use and a shortage of alternative habitats.","An emergent multiple predator effect may enhance biotic resistance in a stream fish assemblage [SEP] While two cyprinid fishes introduced from nearby drainages have become widespread and abundant in the Eel River of northwestern California, a third nonindigenous cyprinid has remained largely confined to less than or equal to25 km of one major tributary.

Exotic herbivores directly facilitate the exotic grasses they graze: mechanisms for an unexpected positive feedback between invaders,"The ability of an exotic species to establish in a system may depend not only on the invasibility of the native community, but also on its interactions with other exotic species. Though examples of mutually beneficial interactions between exotic species are known, few studies have quantified these effects or identified specific mechanisms. We used the co-invasion of an endangered island ecosystem by exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and nine exotic annual grasses to study the effects of an invading herbivore on the success of invading grasses. On our study islands in southwestern Canada, we found that geese fed selectively on the exotic grasses and avoided native forbs. Counter to current theory suggesting that the grasses should be limited by a selective enemy, however, the grasses increased in proportional abundance under grazing whereas forbs showed declining abundance. Testing potential mechanisms for the effects of grazing on grasses, we found that the grasses produced more stems per area when grazing reduced vegetation height and prevented litter accumulation. Forming dense mats of short stems appeared to be an efficient reproductive and competitive strategy that the Eurasian grasses have evolved in the presence of grazers, conferring a competitive advantage in a system where the native species pool has very few annual grasses and no grazers. Germination trials further demonstrated that selective herbivory by geese enables their dispersal of exotic grass seed between heavily invaded feeding areas and the small islands used for nesting. In summary, the exotic geese facilitated both the local increase and the spatial spread of exotic grasses, which in turn provided the majority of their diet. This unexpected case of positive feedback between exotic species suggests that invasion success may depend on the overall differences between the evolutionary histories of the invaders and the evolutionary history of the native community they enter.","Exotic herbivores directly facilitate the exotic grasses they graze: mechanisms for an unexpected positive feedback between invaders [SEP] The ability of an exotic species to establish in a system may depend not only on the invasibility of the native community, but also on its interactions with other exotic species.

Plant community associations of two invasive thistles,"In order to combat the growing problems associated with biological invasions, many researchers have focused on identifying which communities are most vulnerable to invasion by exotic species. However, once established, invasive species can significantly change the composition of the communities that they invade. The first step to disentangling the direction of causality is to discern whether a relationship with other vegetation exists at all. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides are similar invasive thistles, which have caused substantial economic damage worldwide. We assessed the associations between the thistles and the standing flora in four sites in central Pennsylvania in which they co-occur. After sampling nearly 2000 plots of 1 m(2), we used partial Mantel tests to assess the differences in vegetation between thistle and non-thistle plots after accounting for location, and non-metric multidimensional scaling to visualize differences among plots and sites. We found significant differences in community composition in plots with and without Carduus thistles. The non-native species Sisymbrium officinale and Coronilla varia were consistently associated with the presence of Carduus thistles. Several species were associated with areas that were free of Carduus thistles, including an important non-native pasture species (Trifolium repens). We found no evidence for differences in composition between plots with C. nutans versus C. acanthoides, suggesting that they have similar associations with the vegetation community. We conclude that even at the within-field scale, areas invaded by Carduus thistles have different vegetation associations than uninvaded areas, allowing us to target future research about the role of vegetation structure in resisting and responding to invasion.","Plant community associations of two invasive thistles [SEP] In order to combat the growing problems associated with biological invasions, many researchers have focused on identifying which communities are most vulnerable to invasion by exotic species.

A fast-track for invasion: invasive plants promote the performance of an invasive herbivore,"With the greater frequency of biological invasions worldwide there is an increased likelihood that exotic species will interact with each other, and such interactions could enhance one another's invasion potential. Although direct and indirect interactions between exotic species have been well documented for plant-herbivore interactions, the majority of studies have focused on a single interaction and on plant rather than herbivore performance. In this study we investigated whether invasive exotic plants could contribute to the invasion of California by an exotic generalist herbivore (Epiphyas postvittana). We tested this expectation in the greenhouse by monitoring the performance of larval and pupal stages of E. postvittana on six pairs of congeneric invasive and native plants. Larval survivorship and pupal weight of E. postvittana were both greater on the invasive species, and larval development time was shorter on the invasive plant species for two of the plant genera. Our results suggest that prior invasion of exotic plants could function as a catalyst for the subsequent invasion of an exotic insect herbivore, at least in the case where they have shared some history, thereby accelerating the invasion process and expansion of its novel geographic range.","A fast-track for invasion: invasive plants promote the performance of an invasive herbivore [SEP] With the greater frequency of biological invasions worldwide there is an increased likelihood that exotic species will interact with each other, and such interactions could enhance one another's invasion potential.

Herbivory by an introduced Asian weevil negatively affects population growth of an invasive Brazilian shrub in Florida,"The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) is often cited to explain why some plants successfully invade natural communities while others do not. This hypothesis maintains that plant populations are regulated by coevolved enemies in their native range but are relieved of this pressure where their enemies have not been co-introduced. Some studies have shown that invasive plants sustain lower levels of herbivore damage when compared to native species, but how damage affects fitness and population dynamics remains unclear. We used a system of co-occurring native and invasive Eugenia congeners in south Florida (USA) to experimentally test the ERH, addressing deficiencies in our understanding of the role of natural enemies in plant invasion at the population level. Insecticide was used to experimentally exclude insect herbivores from invasive Eugenia uniflora and its native co-occurring congeners in the field for two years. Herbivore damage, plant growth, survival, and population growth rates for the three species were then compared for control and insecticide-treated plants. Our results contradict the ERH, indicating that E. uniflora sustains more herbivore damage than its native congeners and that this damage negatively impacts stem height, survival, and population growth. In addition, most damage to E. uniflora, a native of Brazil, is carried out by Myllocerus undatus, a recently introduced weevil from Sri Lanka, and M. undatus attacks a significantly greater proportion of E. uniflora leaves than those of its native congeners. This interaction is particularly interesting because M. undatus and E. uniflora share no coevolutionary history, having arisen on two separate continents and come into contact on a third. Our study is the first to document negative population-level effects for an invasive plant as a result of the introduction of a novel herbivore. Such inhibitory interactions are likely to become more prevalent as suites of previously noninteracting species continue to accumulate and new communities assemble worldwide.","Herbivory by an introduced Asian weevil negatively affects population growth of an invasive Brazilian shrub in Florida [SEP] The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) is often cited to explain why some plants successfully invade natural communities while others do not.

Strong feeding preference of an exotic generalist herbivore for an exotic forb: a case of invasional antagonism,"Many hypotheses dealing with the success of invasive plant species concern plant-herbivore interactions. The invasional meltdown and enemy inversion hypotheses suggest that non-native herbivores may indirectly facilitate the invasion of a non-native plant species by either favorably changing environmental conditions or reducing competition from native plant species. Our objective was to determine the role of herbivory by the non-native snail Otala lactea in structuring California grassland communities. We conducted two experiments to examine the feeding preferences of O. lactea for eight representative grassland species. Overall, O. lactea preferred Brassica nigra, a non-native forb, over all other species tested. Field monocultures of B. nigra supported significantly higher snail densities than monocultures of any of the other species tested. O. lactea also preferred B. nigra over all other species tested in controlled laboratory feeding trials. However, based on trait comparisons of each of the eight grassland species, we cannot pinpoint the preference for B. nigra to a basic nutritional requirement on the part of the herbivore or an allocation to defense on the part of the plants. Our study provides evidence for an antagonistic relationship between a non-native herbivore and a non-native plant species in their invasive range.

Destruction without extinction: long-term impacts of an invasive tree species on Galapagos highland vegetation,"P>1. A common belief in invasion ecology is that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, but there is little evidence yet that competition from an exotic plant species has led to the extinction of any native plant species at the landscape scale. However, effects of invasive species at community and ecosystem levels can severely compromise conservation goals. 2. Our model species, the red quinine tree (Cinchona pubescens), was introduced to the Galapagos Islands in the 1940s and today extends over at least 11 000 ha in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island. It is also invasive on other oceanic islands. 3. We adopted a long-term approach, analysing permanent plots in the Fern-Sedge vegetation zone over 7 years, to test for impacts of C. pubescens density on resident plant species composition and on microclimate variables. We also tested whether the C. pubescens invasion facilitated the invasion of other species. 4. The rapid pace of the C. pubescens invasion was indicated by a more than doubling of percentage cover, a 4.6-fold increase in mean stand basal area and a 4-fold increase in the number of stems ha-1 in 7 years. 5. Photosynthetically active radiation was reduced by 87% under the C. pubescens canopy while precipitation increased because of enhanced fog interception. 6. Cinchona pubescens significantly decreased species diversity and the cover of most species by at least 50%. Endemic herbaceous species were more adversely affected than non-endemic native species. Stachys agraria, another invasive species, colonized bare ground that developed under the C. pubescens canopy. 7. The numbers of native, endemic and introduced species in the study area remained constant throughout the 7-year period. 8. Synthesis. This study clearly established C. pubescens as a habitat transformer, although its average cover did not exceed 20%. Despite the fact that no plant species has been lost completely from the study area so far, the introduction of the novel tree life form to a formerly treeless environment led to significant changes in stand structure and environmental conditions and to decreases in species diversity and cover. Such changes clearly conflict with conservation goals as set by the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Destruction without extinction: long-term impacts of an invasive tree species on Galapagos highland vegetation [SEP] P>1.

"Enemy release or invasional meltdown? Deer preference for exotic and native trees on Isla Victoria, Argentina","Abstract How interactions between exotic species affect invasion impact is a fundamental issue on both theoretical and applied grounds. Exotics can facilitate establishment and invasion of other exotics (invasional meltdown) or they can restrict them by re-establishing natural population control (as predicted by the enemy-release hypothesis). We studied forest invasion on an Argentinean island where 43 species of Pinaceae, including 60% of the world's recorded invasive Pinaceae, were introduced c. 1920 but where few species are colonizing pristine areas. In this area two species of Palearctic deer, natural enemies of most Pinaceae, were introduced 80 years ago. Expecting deer to help to control the exotics, we conducted a cafeteria experiment to assess deer preferences among the two dominant native species (a conifer, Austrocedrus chilensis, and a broadleaf, Nothofagus dombeyi) and two widely introduced exotic tree species (Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus ponderosa). Deer browsed much more intensively on native species than on exotic conifers, in terms of number of individuals attacked and degree of browsing. Deer preference for natives could potentially facilitate invasion by exotic pines. However, we hypothesize that the low rates of invasion currently observed can result at least partly from high densities of exotic deer, which, despite their preference for natives, can prevent establishment of both native and exotic trees. Other factors, not mutually exclusive, could produce the observed pattern. Our results underscore the difficulty of predicting how one introduced species will effect impact of another one.","Enemy release or invasional meltdown?

Effects of invasive cordgrass on presence of marsh grassbird in an area where it is not native,"The threatened Marsh Grassbird (Locustella pryeri) first appeared in the salt marsh in east China after the salt marsh was invaded by cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), a non-native invasive species. To understand the dependence of non-native Marsh Grassbird on the non-native cordgrass, we quantified habitat use, food source, and reproductive success of the Marsh Grassbird at the Chongming Dongtan (CMDT) salt marsh. In the breeding season, we used point counts and radio-tracking to determine habitat use by Marsh Grassbirds. We analyzed basal food sources of the Marsh Grassbirds by comparing the delta(13) C isotope signatures of feather and fecal samples of birds with those of local plants. We monitored the nests through the breeding season and determined the breeding success of the Marsh Grassbirds at CMDT. Density of Marsh Grassbirds was higher where cordgrass occurred than in areas of native reed (Phragmites australis) monoculture. The breeding territory of the Marsh Grassbird was composed mainly of cordgrass stands, and nests were built exclusively against cordgrass stems. Cordgrass was the major primary producer at the base of the Marsh Grassbird food chain. Breeding success of the Marsh Grassbird at CMDT was similar to breeding success within its native range. Our results suggest non-native cordgrass provides essential habitat and food for breeding Marsh Grassbirds at CMDT and that the increase in Marsh Grassbird abundance may reflect the rapid spread of cordgrass in the coastal regions of east China. Our study provides an example of how a primary invader (i.e., cordgrass) can alter an ecosystem and thus facilitate colonization by a second non-native species.

For instance, resource availability and biotic interactions may represent filters that limit the success of potential invaders. Communities are predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity) and soil N availability. We fertilized to increase N, and added carbon to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient availability and the timing of biotic interactions are key filters that can be manipulated in restoration to prevent invasion and maximize native species recovery.","Strengthening Invasion Filters to Reassemble Native Plant Communities: Soil Resources and Phenological Overlap [SEP] Preventing invasion by exotic species is one of the key goals of restoration, and community assembly theory provides testable predictions about native community attributes that will best resist invasion.

Limiting similarity between invaders and dominant species in herbaceous plant communities?,"Summary - Limiting similarity theory predicts that successful invaders should differ functionally from species already present in the community. This theory has been tested by manipulating the functional richness of communities, but not other aspects of functional diversity such as the identity of dominant species. Because dominant species are known to have strong effects on ecosystem functioning, I hypothesized that successful invaders should be functionally dissimilar from community dominants. - To test this hypothesis, I added seeds of 17 different species to two different experiments: one in a natural oldfield community that had patches dominated by different plant species, and one in grassland mesocosms that varied in the identity of the dominant species but not in species richness or evenness. I used indicator species analyses to test whether invaders had higher establishment success in plots with functionally different dominant species. - A large percentage of invader species (47-71%) in both experiments showed no difference in affinity across the different dominant treatments, although one-third of species did show some evidence for limiting similarity. Exotic invaders had much higher invasion success than native invaders, and seemed to be inhibited by dominant species that were functionally similar. However, even these invasion patterns were not consistent across the two experiments. - The results from this study show that there is some evidence that dominant species suppress invasion by functionally similar species, beyond the effect of simple presence or absence of species in communities, although it is not the sole factor affecting invasion success. Patterns of invasion success were inconsistent across species and experiments, indicating that other studies using only a single species of invader to make conclusions about community invasibility should be interpreted with caution.

Testing Fox's assembly rule: does plant invasion depend on recipient community structure?,"Fox's assembly rule, that relative dearth of certain functional groups in a community will facilitate invasion of that particular functional group, serves as the basis for investigation into the functional group effects of invasion resistance. We explored resistance to plant invaders by eliminating or decreasing the number of understory plant species in particular functional groups from plots at a riparian site in southwestern Virginia, USA. Our functional groups comprise combinations of aboveground biomass and rooting structure type. Manipulated plots were planted with 10 randomly chosen species from widespread native and introduced plants commonly found throughout the floodplains of Big Stony Creek. We assessed success of an invasion by plant survivorship and growth. We analyzed survivorship of functional groups with loglinear models for the analysis of categorical data in a 4-way table. There was a significant interaction between functional groups removed in a plot and survivorship in the functional groups added to that plot. However, survivorship of species in functional groups introduced into plots with their respective functional group removed did not differ from survivorship when any other functional group was removed. Additionally, growth of each of the most abundant species did not differ significantly among plots with different functional groups manipulated. Specifically, species did not fare better in those plots that had representatives of their own functional group removed. Fox's assembly rule does not hold for these functional groups in this plant community; however, composition of the recipient community is a significant factor in community assembly.","Testing Fox's assembly rule: does plant invasion depend on recipient community structure?

Are competitive effects of native species on an invader mediated by water availability?,"Climate change processes could influence the dynamics of biotic interactions such as plant competition, especially in response to disturbance phenomena such as invasional processes. Are competitive effects of native species on an invader mediated by water availability? Glasshouse facility, New South Wales, Australia. We constructed competitive hierarchies for a representative suite of species from coastal dune communities that have been invaded by the Asteraceae shrub, bitou (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata). We used a comparative phytometer approach, where the invader species was grown with or without a suite of native species in glasshouse trials. This was used to construct competition hierarchies under two water stress conditions: non-droughted and droughted. The treatments were designed to simulate current and potential future water availability respectively. We found that the invader experienced fewer competitive effects from some native species under water stress, particularly with regard to below-ground biomass effects. Native species were often poor competitors with the invader, despite their adaptation to periodic water stress in native coastal environments. Of the native species with significant competitive effects on the invader, functionally similar shrub species were the most effective competitors, as expressed in below-ground biomass. The relative position of species in the hierarchy was consistent across water treatments based on below-ground bitou biomass, but was contingent on water treatment when based on above-ground bitou biomass. The competitive effects of native species on an invader are affected by water stress. While the direction of response to water stress is species-specific, many species have small competitive effects on the invader under droughted conditions. This could allow an increase in invader dominance with climate change.","Are competitive effects of native species on an invader mediated by water availability?

Preadapted for invasiveness: do species traits or their plastic response to shading differ between invasive and non-invasive plant species in their native range?,"Aim Species capable of vigorous growth under a wide range of environmental conditions should have a higher chance of becoming invasive after introduction into new regions. High performance across environments can be achieved either by constitutively expressed traits that allow for high resource uptake under different environmental conditions or by adaptive plasticity of traits. Here we test whether invasive and non-invasive species differ in presumably adaptive plasticity. Location Europe (for native species); the rest of the world and North America in particular (for alien species). Methods We selected 14 congeneric pairs of European herbaceous species that have all been introduced elsewhere. One species of each pair is highly invasive elsewhere in the world, particularly so in North America, whereas the other species has not become invasive or has spread only to a limited degree. We grew native plant material of the 28 species under shaded and non-shaded conditions in a common garden experiment, and measured biomass production and morphological traits that are frequently related to shade tolerance and avoidance. Results Invasive species had higher shoot-root ratios, tended to have longer leaf-blades, and produced more biomass than congeneric non-invasive species both under shaded and non-shaded conditions. Plants responded to shading by increasing shoot-root ratios and specific leaf area. Surprisingly, these shade-induced responses, which are widely considered to be adaptive, did not differ between invasive and non-invasive species. Main conclusions We conclude that high biomass production across different light environments pre-adapts species to become invasive, and that this is not mediated by plasticities of the morphological traits that we measured.","Preadapted for invasiveness: do species traits or their plastic response to shading differ between invasive and non-invasive plant species in their native range?

How does Reynoutria invasion fit the various theories of invasibility?,"Questions: 1. How does species richness of recipient communities affect Reynoutria invasion? 2. How does Reynoutria invasion change host community structure? 3. Are there any differences in habitat preferences among three closely related Reynoutria taxa? 4. How does the genetic structure of Reynoutria populations change along the course of a river? Location: River Jizera basin, north Bohemia, Czech Republic. Methods: Nine 0.25 km2 plots were chosen along the river. Within each plot all main habitat types were determined and sampled using the Braun-Blanquet scale to determine the invasibility of various communities. The patches invaded by Reynoutria taxa and surrounding Reynoutria-free vegetation in the same habitat type were sampled as releve pairs to compare the composition of invaded and non-invaded vegetation. In addition, to characterize the genetic structure of Reynoutria populations along the river, 30 samples from different clones were collected. Results and conclusions: 1. The species richness of communities has no influence on the success of Reynoutria invasion in the area studied. The combination of environmental conditions and propagule spread is more important to the invasion success than the number of species in the host community. 2. Reynoutria invasion greatly reduces species diversity. 3. R. japonica invaded more habitat types than R. sachalinensis and R. bohemica. The hybrid R. bohemica outcompetes the parental taxa at sites where both taxa co-occur. 4. Isozyme analysis revealed phenotype variability in the hybrid in contrast to the parental taxa. Different hybrid phenotypes are distributed randomly on the middle and lower reaches of the River Jizera; one of them dominates and the other three occur occasionally. This pattern supports the hypothesis that sexual reproduction occasionally occurs within Reynoutria taxa.","How does Reynoutria invasion fit the various theories of invasibility? [SEP] Questions: 1.

"Soil disturbance, vegetation cover and the establishment of the exotic shrub Pyracantha coccinea in southern France","We evaluate the mechanisms that determine the establishment of the non-indigenous shrub Pyracantha coccinea (Rosaceae) in the Montpellier region of southern France. P. coccinea establishes in abandoned agricultural fields in this region; yet, despite its high propagule pressure, it has not become a widespread invasive. We hypothesized that the disturbance conditions prevailing in abandoned agricultural fields right after abandonment may enhance the emergence, survival and growth of P. coccinea, but that shortly after abandonment colonizing vegetation prevents further establishment of this species. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate this hypothesis, studying the response of seedling emergence and growth of P. coccinea to soil and vegetation disturbance. Our results show that both lack of vegetation cover and soil disturbance promote the emergence of seedlings of P. coccinea. Thus, the disturbance conditions prevailing in abandoned agricultural fields seem crucial to allow establishment of this species. However, other factors such as lack of summer dormancy and seed predation might explain why this species has not become a widespread invasive.","Soil disturbance, vegetation cover and the establishment of the exotic shrub Pyracantha coccinea in southern France [SEP] We evaluate the mechanisms that determine the establishment of the non-indigenous shrub Pyracantha coccinea (Rosaceae) in the Montpellier region of southern France.

Post-dispersal losses to seed predators: an experimental comparison of native and exotic old field plants,"Invasions by exotic plants may be more likely if exotics have low rates of attack by natural enemies, including post-dispersal seed predators (granivores). We investigated this idea with a field experiment conducted near Newmarket, Ontario, in which we experimentally excluded vertebrate and terrestrial insect seed predators from seeds of 43 native and exotic old-field plants. Protection from vertebrates significantly increased recovery of seeds; vertebrate exclusion produced higher recovery than controls for 30 of the experimental species, increasing overall seed recovery from 38.2 to 45.6%. Losses to vertebrates varied among species, significantly increasing with seed mass. In contrast, insect exclusion did not significantly improve seed recovery. There was no evidence that aliens benefitted from a reduced rate of post-dispersal seed predation. The impacts of seed predators did not differ significantly between natives and exotics, which instead showed very similar responses to predator exclusion treatments. These results indicate that while vertebrate granivores had important impacts, especially on large-seeded species, exotics did not generally benefit from reduced rates of seed predation. Instead, differences between natives and exotics were small compared with interspecific variation within these groups.","Post-dispersal losses to seed predators: an experimental comparison of native and exotic old field plants [SEP] Invasions by exotic plants may be more likely if exotics have low rates of attack by natural enemies, including post-dispersal seed predators (granivores).

Seed and seedling demography of invasive and native trees of subtropical Pacific islands,"Bischofia javanica is an invasive tree of the Bonin Islands in the western Pacific, Japan. This species has aggressive growth, competitively replacing native trees in the natural forest of the islands. The aim of this study was to examine seed and seedling factors which might confer an advantage to the establishment of Bischofia over native trees. During a 5-yr period we compared the demographic parameters of early life history of Bischofia and Elaeocarpus photiniae-folius, a native canopy dominant, in actively invaded forests. Predation of Elaeocarpus seeds by introduced rodents was much higher before (27.9-32.9%) and after (41.3-100%) dispersal of seeds than that of B. javanica. Most Elaeocarpus seeds lost viability ca. 6 mo after burial in forest soil while some seeds of Bischofia remained viable for more than 2 yr. Seedling survival in the first 2 yr was much higher in Bischofia (16%) than in Elaeocarpus (1.3%). The high persistence of Bischofia in the shade, coupled to its rapid acclimation to high light levels, is an unusual combination because in forest tree species there is generally a trade-off between seedling survival in the shade and response to canopy opening. Compared with a native canopy dominant, greater seed longevity, lower seed predation by introduced rodents, longer fruiting periods and the ability to form seedling banks under closed canopy appear to have contributed to the invasive success of Bischofia on the Bonin Islands.","Seed and seedling demography of invasive and native trees of subtropical Pacific islands [SEP] Bischofia javanica is an invasive tree of the Bonin Islands in the western Pacific, Japan.

As a whole, effects of water regime on structures in stem were greater than those in leaf. Except for principal vein diameter and stoma density on leaf surfaces, all other structural traits were significantly affected by water regime. Among which, cuticular wax layer, collenchyma cell wall, phloem fiber cell wall, and hair density on both leaf surfaces thickened significantly with decrease of water availability, whereas, pith cavity and vessel lumen in stem lessened significantly; wet habitat is vital for the spread of A. philoxeroides from flooding to drought habitat and vice versa, because in this habitat, it had the greatest structural variations; when switching from flooding to wet then to drought habitat, the variations of cuticular wax layer, collenchyma cell wall, phloem fiber cell wall, pith cavity area ratio, diameter of vessel lumen, and hair density on both leaf surfaces, played the most important role.

"Phenotypic plasticity, precipitation, and invasiveness in the fire-promoting grass Pennisetum setaceum (poaceae)","Invasiveness may result from genetic variation and adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, and genetic variation in fitness traits may be especially critical. Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass, Poaceae) is highly invasive in Hawaii (HI), moderately invasive in Arizona (AZ), and less invasive in southern California (CA). In common garden experiments, we examined the relative importance of quantitative trait variation, precipitation, and phenotypic plasticity in invasiveness. In two very different environments, plants showed no differences by state of origin (HI, CA, AZ) in aboveground biomass, seeds/flower, and total seed number. Plants from different states were also similar within watering treatment. Plants with supplemental watering, relative to unwatered plants, had greater biomass, specific leaf area (SLA), and total seed number, but did not differ in seeds/flower. Progeny grown from seeds produced under different watering treatments showed no maternal effects in seed mass, germination, biomass or SLA. High phenotypic plasticity, rather than local adaptation is likely responsible for variation in invasiveness. Global change models indicate that temperature and precipitation patterns over the next several decades will change, although the direction of change is uncertain. Drier summers in southern California may retard further invasion, while wetter summers may favor the spread of fountain grass.","Phenotypic plasticity, precipitation, and invasiveness in the fire-promoting grass Pennisetum setaceum (poaceae) [SEP] Invasiveness may result from genetic variation and adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, and genetic variation in fitness traits may be especially critical.

High phenotypic plasticity, rather than local adaptation is likely responsible for variation in invasiveness. Global change models indicate that temperature and precipitation patterns over the next several decades will change, although the direction of change is uncertain.

Jack-of-all-trades: phenotypic plasticity facilitates the invasion of an alien slug species,"Invasive alien species might benefit from phenotypic plasticity by being able to (i) maintain fitness in stressful environments ('robust'), (ii) increase fitness in favourable environments ('opportunistic'), or (iii) combine both abilities ('robust and opportunistic'). Here, we applied this framework, for the first time, to an animal, the invasive slug, Arion lusitanicus, and tested (i) whether it has a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity compared with a congeneric native slug, Arion fuscus, and (ii) whether it is robust, opportunistic or both. During one year, we exposed specimens of both species to a range of temperatures along an altitudinal gradient (700-2400 m a.s.l.) and to high and low food levels, and we compared the responsiveness of two fitness traits: survival and egg production. During summer, the invasive species had a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and at high temperatures and low food levels, it survived better and produced more eggs than A. fuscus, representing the robust phenotype. During winter, A. lusitanicus displayed a less adaptive phenotype than A. fuscus. We show that the framework developed for plants is also very useful for a better mechanistic understanding of animal invasions. Warmer summers and milder winters might lead to an expansion of this invasive species to higher altitudes and enhance its spread in the lowlands, supporting the concern that global climate change will increase biological invasions.","Jack-of-all-trades: phenotypic plasticity facilitates the invasion of an alien slug species [SEP] Invasive alien species might benefit from phenotypic plasticity by being able to (i) maintain fitness in stressful environments ('robust'), (ii) increase fitness in favourable environments ('opportunistic'), or (iii) combine both abilities ('robust and opportunistic').

Induced defenses in response to an invading crab predator: An explanation of historical and geographic phenotypic change,"The expression of defensive morphologies in prey often is correlated with predator abundance or diversity over a range of temporal and spatial scales. These patterns are assumed to reflect natural selection via differential predation on genetically determined, fixed phenotypes. Phenotypic variation, however, also can reflect within-generation developmental responses to environmental cues (phenotypic plasticity). For example, water-borne effluents from predators can induce the production of defensive morphologies in many prey taxa. This phenomenon, however, has been examined only on narrow scales. Here, we demonstrate adaptive phenotypic plasticity in prey from geographically separated populations that were reared in the presence of an introduced predator. Marine snails exposed to predatory crab effluent in the field increased shell thickness rapidly compared with controls. Induced changes were comparable to (i) historical transitions in thickness previously attributed to selection by the invading predator and (ii) present-day clinal variation predicted from water temperature differences. Thus, predator-induced phenotypic plasticity may explain broad-scale geographic and temporal phenotypic variation. If inducible defenses are heritable, then selection on the reaction norm may influence coevolution between predator and prey. Trade-offs may explain why inducible rather than constitutive defenses have evolved in several gastropod species.","Induced defenses in response to an invading crab predator: An explanation of historical and geographic phenotypic change [SEP] The expression of defensive morphologies in prey often is correlated with predator abundance or diversity over a range of temporal and spatial scales.

Experimental microevolution: transplantation of pink salmon into the European North,"Human-mediated translocations of species beyond their native ranges can enhance evolutionary processes in populations introduced to novel environments. We studied such processes in several generations of pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha introduced to the European North of Russia using a set of morphological and life-history traits as well as molecular genetic markers with different selective values: protein-coding loci, mtDNA, microsatellites, and MHC. The introduction of reproductively isolated pink salmon broodlines of odd and even years yielded different results. The odd-year broodline established self-reproducing local populations in many rivers of new range, but sustainable changes in external morphology, reproduction, and life-history, as well as the impoverishment of the gene pool occurred. Their successful colonisation of the new range resulted in specialisation manifested in the rapid directional shifts in some highly heritable phenotypic traits accompanied by increased homozygosity at molecular markers as a consequence of genetic drift and selective processes. The returns of transplanted pink salmon of even-year broodline decreased sharply already in the second generation, but there was no marked reduction of genetic diversity. Our data, as well as the analysis of the history of all pink salmon transplantations beyond the species range, demonstrate comparatively greater success of introduced odd-year broodline and permit to assume different adaptive plasticity of the even- and odd-year broodlines in pink salmon, what is most likely determined by differences in their evolutionary histories. Population genetic data suggest that the even-year broodline probably diverged from the odd-year broodline relatively recently and, due to the founder effect, may have lost a part of its genetic variation with which adaptive plasticity potential is associated.","Experimental microevolution: transplantation of pink salmon into the European North [SEP] Human-mediated translocations of species beyond their native ranges can enhance evolutionary processes in populations introduced to novel environments.

Heritable pollution tolerance in a marine invader,"The global spread of fouling invasive species is continuing despite the use of antifouling biocides. Furthermore, previous evidence suggests that non-indigenous species introduced via hull fouling may be capable of adapting to metal-polluted environments. Using a laboratory based toxicity assay, we investigated tolerance to copper in the non-indigenous bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata from four source populations. Individual colonies were collected from four sites within Port Hacking (Sydney, Australia) and their offspring exposed to a range of copper concentrations. This approach, using a fullsib, split-family design, tests for a genotype by environment (G x E) interaction. Settlement and complete metamorphosis (recruitment) were measured as ecologically relevant endpoints. Larval sizes were also measured for each colony. Successful recruitment was significantly reduced by the highest copper concentration of 80 mu g L-1. While there was no difference in pollution tolerance between sites, there was a significant G x E interaction, with large variation in the response of colony offspring within sites. Larval size differed significantly both between sites and between colonies and was positively correlated with tolerance. The high level of variation in copper tolerance between colonies suggests that there is considerable potential within populations to adapt to elevated copper levels, as tolerance is a heritable trait. Also, colonies that produce large larvae are more tolerant to copper, suggesting that tolerance may be a direct consequence of larger size. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Major morphological changes in a Lake Victoria cichlid fish within two decades,"During the upsurge of the introduced predatory Nile perch in Lake Victoria in the 1980s, the zooplanktivorous Haplochromis (Yssichromis) pyrrhocephalus nearly vanished. The species recovered coincident with the intense fishing of Nile perch in the 1990s, when water clarity and dissolved oxygen levels had decreased dramatically due to increased eutrophication. In response to the hypoxic conditions, total gill surface in resurgent H. pyrrhocephalus increased by 64%. Remarkably, head length, eye length, and head volume decreased in size, whereas cheek depth increased. Reductions in eye size and depth of the rostral part of the musculus sternohyoideus, and reallocation of space between the opercular and suspensorial compartments of the head may have permitted accommodation of larger gills in a smaller head. By contrast, the musculus levator posterior, located dorsal to the gills, increased in depth. This probably reflects an adaptive response to the larger and tougher prey types in the diet of resurgent H. pyrrhocephalus. These striking morphological changes over a time span of only two decades could be the combined result of phenotypic plasticity and genetic change and may have fostered recovery of this species.

Hard traits of three Bromus species in their source area explain their current invasive success,"We address two highly essential question using three Eurasian Bromus species with different invasion success in North America as model organisms: (1) why some species become invasive and others do not, and (2) which traits can confer pre-adaptation for species to become invasive elsewhere. While the morphology and phenology of the chosen bromes (Bromus tectorum, Bromus sterilis and Bromus squarrosus) are highly similar, we measured complex traits often associated with invasive success: phenotypic plasticity, competitive ability and generalist-specialist character. We performed common-garden experiments, community- and landscape-level surveys in areas of co-occurrence in Central Europe (Hungary) that could have served as donor region for American introductions. According to our results, the three bromes are unequally equipped with trait that could enhance invasiveness. B. tectorum possesses several traits that may be especially relevant: it has uniquely high phenotypic plasticity, as demonstrated in a nitrogen addition experiment, and it is a habitat generalist, thriving in a wide range of habitats, from semi-natural to degraded ones, and having the widest co-occurrence based niche-breadth. The strength of B. sterilis lies in its ability to use resources unexploited by other species. It can become dominant, but only in one non-natural habitat type, namely the understorey of the highly allelopathic stands of the invasive Robinia pseudoacacia. B. squarrosus is a habitat specialist with low competitive ability, always occurring with low coverage. This ranking of the species' abilities can explain the current spreading success of the three bromes on the North American continent, and highlight the high potential of prehistoric invaders (European archaeophytes) to become invasive elsewhere.

Phenotypic plasticity of an invasive acacia versus two native Mediterranean species,"The phenotypic plasticity and the competitive ability of the invasive Acacia longifolia v. the indigenous Mediterranean dune species Halimium halimifolium and Pinus pinea were evaluated. In particular, we explored the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity in response to biotic and abiotic factors explains the observed differences in competitiveness between invasive and native species. The seedlings' ability to exploit different resource availabilities was examined in a two factorial experimental design of light and nutrient treatments by analysing 20 physiological and morphological traits. Competitiveness was tested using an additive experimental design in combination with N-15-labelling experiments. Light and nutrient availability had only minor effects on most physiological traits and differences between species were not significant. Plasticity in response to changes in resource availability occurred in morphological and allocation traits, revealing A. longifolia to be a species of intermediate responsiveness. The major competitive advantage of A. longifolia was its constitutively high shoot elongation rate at most resource treatments and its effective nutrient acquisition. Further, A. longifolia was found to be highly tolerant against competition from native species. In contrast to common expectations, the competition experiment indicated that A. longifolia expressed a constant allocation pattern and a phenotypic plasticity similar to that of the native species.","Phenotypic plasticity of an invasive acacia versus two native Mediterranean species [SEP] The phenotypic plasticity and the competitive ability of the invasive Acacia longifolia v. the indigenous Mediterranean dune species Halimium halimifolium and Pinus pinea were evaluated.

In contrast, plants in the native range only exhibited a decrease in height. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that secondary invasion is taking place in L. salicaria, allowing it to be more successful under the more stressful mesic conditions in the invaded range.

Leaf ontogenetic dependence of light acclimation in invasive and native subtropical trees of different successional status,"In the Bonin Islands of the western Pacific where the light environment is characterized by high fluctuations due to frequent typhoon disturbance, we hypothesized that the invasive success of Bischofia javanica Blume (invasive tree, mid-successional) may be attributable to a high acclimation capacity under fluctuating light availability.

Koidz (mid-successional) and Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius Hook.et Arn (late-successional). The results revealed significant species-specific differences in the timing of physiological maturity and phenotypic plasticity in leaves developed under constant high and low light levels. For example, the photosynthetic capacity of T. orientalis reached a maximum in leaves that had just fully expanded when grown under constant high light (50% of full sun) whereas that of E . photiniaefolius leaves continued to increase until 50 d after full expansion. For leaves that had just reached full expansion, T. orientalis , having high photosynthetic plasticity between high and low light, exhibited low acclimation capacity under the changing light (from high to low or low to high light). In comparison with native species, B. javanica showed a higher degree of physiological and morphological acclimation following transfer to a new light condition in leaves of all age classes (i.e. before and after reaching full expansion). The high acclimation ability of B. javanica in response to changes in light availability may be a part of its pre-adaptations for invasiveness in the fluctuating environment of the Bonin Islands.","Leaf ontogenetic dependence of light acclimation in invasive and native subtropical trees of different successional status [SEP] In the Bonin Islands of the western Pacific where the light environment is characterized by high fluctuations due to frequent typhoon disturbance, we hypothesized that the invasive success of Bischofia javanica Blume (invasive tree, mid-successional) may be attributable to a high acclimation capacity under fluctuating light availability.

"Allometric growth, disturbance regime, and dilemmas of controlling invasive plants: a model analysis","Disturbed communities are observed to be more susceptible to invasion by exotic species, suggesting that some attributes of the invaders may interact with disturbance regime to facilitate invasion success. Alternanthera philoxeroides, endemic to South America, is an amphibious clonal weed invading worldwide. It tends to colonize disturbed habitats such as riparian zones, floodplain wetlands and agricultural areas. We developed an analytical model to explore the interactive effects of two types of physical disturbances, shoot mowing and root fragmentation, on biomass production dynamics of A. philoxeroides. The model is based on two major biological assumptions: (1) allometric growth of root (belowground) vs. shoot (aboveground) biomass and (2) exponential regrowth of shoot biomass after mowing. The model analysis revealed that the interaction among allometric growth pattern, shoot mowing frequency and root fragmentation intensity might lead to diverse plant 'fates'. For A. philoxeroides whose root allocation decreases with growing plant size, control by shoot mowing was faced with two dilemmas. (1) Shoot regrowth can be effectively suppressed by frequent mowing. However, frequent shoot mowing led to higher biomass allocation to thick storage roots, which enhanced the potential for faster future plant growth. (2) In the context of periodic shoot mowing, individual shoot biomass converged to a stable equilibrium value which was independent of the root fragmentation intensity. However, root fragmentation resulted in higher equilibrium population shoot biomass and higher frequency of shoot mowing required for effective control. In conclusion, the interaction between allometric growth and physical disturbances may partially account for the successful invasion of A. philoxeroides; improper mechanical control practices could function as disturbances and result in exacerbated invasion.","Allometric growth, disturbance regime, and dilemmas of controlling invasive plants: a model analysis [SEP] Disturbed communities are observed to be more susceptible to invasion by exotic species, suggesting that some attributes of the invaders may interact with disturbance regime to facilitate invasion success.

Shell morphology and relative growth variability of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata in coastal Tunisia,"The variability of shell morphology and relative growth of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata was studied within and among ten populations from coastal Tunisia using discriminant tests. Therefore, 12 morphological characters were examined and 34 metric and weight ratios were defined. In addition to the classic morphological characters, populations were compared by the thickness of the nacreous layer. Results of Duncan's multiple comparison test showed that the most discriminative ratios were the width of nacreous layer of right valve to the inflation of shell, the hinge line length to the maximum width of shell and the nacre thickness to the maximum width of shell. The analysis of variance revealed an important inter-population morphological variability. Both multidimensional scaling analysis and the squared Mahalanobis distances (D-2) of metric ratios divided Tunisian P. radiata populations into four biogeographical groupings: the north coast (La Marsa); harbours (Hammamet, Monastir and Zarzis); the Gulf of Gabe's (Sfax, Kerkennah Island, Mahare's, Skhira and Djerba) and the intertidal area (Ajim). However, the Kerkennah Island population was discriminated by the squared Mahalanobis distances (D-2) of weight ratios in an isolated group suggesting particular trophic conditions in this area. The allometric study revealed high linear correlation between shell morphological characters and differences in allometric growth among P. radiata populations. Unlike the morphological discrimination, allometric differentiation shows no clear geographical distinction. This study revealed that the pearl oyster P. radiata exhibited considerable phenotypic plasticity related to differences of environmental and/or ecological conditions along Tunisian coasts and highlighted the discriminative character of the nacreous layer thickness parameter.","Shell morphology and relative growth variability of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata in coastal Tunisia [SEP] The variability of shell morphology and relative growth of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata was studied within and among ten populations from coastal Tunisia using discriminant tests.

Multispecies comparison reveals that invasive and native plants differ in their traits but not in their plasticity,"1. Plastic responses to spatiotemporal environmental variation strongly influence species distribution, with widespread species expected to have high phenotypic plasticity. Theoretically, high phenotypic plasticity has been linked to plant invasiveness because it facilitates colonization and rapid spreading over large and environmentally heterogeneous new areas. 2. To determine the importance of phenotypic plasticity for plant invasiveness, we compare well-known exotic invasive species with widespread native congeners. First, we characterized the phenotype of 20 invasive-native ecologically and phylogenetically related pairs from the Mediterranean region by measuring 20 different traits involved in resource acquisition, plant competition ability and stress tolerance. Second, we estimated their plasticity across nutrient and light gradients. 3. On average, invasive species had greater capacity for carbon gain and enhanced performance over a range of limiting to saturating resource availabilities than natives. However, both groups responded to environmental variations with high albeit similar levels of trait plasticity. Therefore, contrary to the theory, the extent of phenotypic plasticity was not significantly higher for invasive plants. 4. We argue that the combination of studying mean values of a trait with its plasticity can render insightful conclusions on functional comparisons of species such as those exploring the performance of species coexisting in heterogeneous and changing environments.","Multispecies comparison reveals that invasive and native plants differ in their traits but not in their plasticity [SEP] 1.

Forests are not immune to plant invasions: phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation allow Prunella vulgaris to colonize a temperate evergreen rainforest,"In the South American temperate evergreen rainforest (Valdivian forest), invasive plants are mainly restricted to open sites, being rare in the shaded understory. This is consistent with the notion of closed-canopy forests as communities relatively resistant to plant invasions. However, alien plants able to develop shade tolerance could be a threat to this unique forest. Phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation are two mechanisms enhancing invasiveness. Phenotypic plasticity can promote local adaptation by facilitating the establishment and persistence of invasive species in novel environments. We investigated the role of these processes in the recent colonization of Valdivian forest understory by the perennial alien herb Prunella vulgaris from nearby populations in open sites. Using reciprocal transplants, we found local adaptation between populations. Field data showed that the shade environment selected for taller plants and greater specific leaf areas. We found population differentiation and within-population genetic variation in both mean values and reaction norms to light variation of several ecophysiological traits in common gardens from seeds collected in sun and shade populations. The colonization of the forest resulted in a reduction of plastic responses to light variation, which is consistent with the occurrence of genetic assimilation and suggests that P. vulgaris individuals adapted to the shade have reduced probabilities to return to open sites. All results taken together confirm the potential for rapid evolution of shade tolerance in P. vulgaris and suggest that this alien species may pose a threat to the native understory flora of Valdivian forest.

Nonnative African jewelfish are more fit but not bolder at the invasion front: a trait comparison across an Everglades range expansion,"Invasive species present a global threat to natural ecosystems and native biodiversity. Previous studies have shown that invasive range expansion is often related to the invader's life histories and dispersal behavior. Among behavioral traits, boldness is a key trait that may aid species in performing well in novel environments. Thus, along a species' invaded range, individuals from the invasion front should be bolder, better dispersers, and have life histories that maximize population growth relative to established populations. We tested these hypotheses with the invasion of the African jewelfish Hemichromis letourneuxi in Everglades National Park (ENP). Jewelfish entered ENP in 2000, and since then they have expanded their range rapidly but traceably. Our study examined variation in reproductive investment, body condition, gut fullness, boldness, and dispersal behavior across six wild-caught populations of African jewelfish. Boldness and dispersal were tested using an emergence-activity test and an emergence-dispersal test in large, outdoor experimental setups. We dissected fish from the six populations to assess life histories. Populations from the invasion front (western ENP) had higher reproductive investment, higher gut fullness, and better body condition, but they were not relatively bolder nor better dispersers than inner populations (eastern ENP). As the invasion progressed, lower intraspecific density at the invasion front may have relaxed competition and allowed for higher fitness and reproductive investment. Understanding underlying behavioral and life-history mechanisms of an invasion is key for the development of management strategies that aim to contain current invaders and prevent the spread of future ones.","Nonnative African jewelfish are more fit but not bolder at the invasion front: a trait comparison across an Everglades range expansion [SEP] Invasive species present a global threat to natural ecosystems and native biodiversity.

Number of source populations as a potential driver of pine invasions in Brazil,"To understand current patterns of Pinus invasion in an Araucaria forest in southern Brazil, we quantified invasion at the local scale and compared it with habitat characteristics, propagule size, and number of source populations, using generalized linear models. We also compared observed and expected invasive species status based on a previously developed model (Z scores) using Chi square and correlation tests to evaluate the predictability of species status based on their traits. Of the 16 Pinus species currently present in the site, three are invasive (P. elliottii, P. glabra, and P. taeda), three are naturalized (P. clausa, P. oocarpa, and P. pseudostrobus), and ten are present only as the originally planted individuals. While P. taeda spread the farthest, P. glabra had greater overall density, but none of the invasive species has spread more than 250 m in 45 years. Invasive Pinus plants were found where forest tree density was below 805 trees ha(-1), and invasive Pinus density decreased log-linearly with an increase in native tree density. Number of individuals introduced and number of source populations were strong predictors of naturalization, thus both propagule size and propagule diversity can potentially be driving invasion success. Z scores based on species traits did not predict which species would invade in Rio Negro. Our findings suggest that Araucaria forests might not resist invasion by Pinus as recently suggested and support the hypothesis that propagule pressure is a fundamental driver of invasions with propagule diversity being a possible component of this mechanism.","Number of source populations as a potential driver of pine invasions in Brazil [SEP] To understand current patterns of Pinus invasion in an Araucaria forest in southern Brazil, we quantified invasion at the local scale and compared it with habitat characteristics, propagule size, and number of source populations, using generalized linear models.

Factors explaining alien plant invasion success in a tropical ecosystem differ at each stage of invasion,"1. Understanding why some alien plant species become invasive when others fail is a fundamental goal in invasion ecology. We used detailed historical planting records of alien plant species introduced to Amani Botanical Garden, Tanzania and contemporary surveys of their invasion status to assess the relative ability of phylogeny, propagule pressure, residence time, plant traits and other factors to explain the success of alien plant species at different stages of the invasion process. 2. Species with native ranges centred in the tropics and with larger seeds were more likely to regenerate, whereas naturalization success was explained by longer residence time, faster growth rate, fewer seeds per fruit, smaller seed mass and shade tolerance. 3. Naturalized species spreading greater distances from original plantings tended to have more seeds per fruit, whereas species dispersed by canopy-feeding animals and with native ranges centred on the tropics tended to have spread more widely in the botanical garden. Species dispersed by canopy-feeding animals and with greater seed mass were more likely to be established in closed forest. 4. Phylogeny alone made a relatively minor contribution to the explanatory power of statistical models, but a greater proportion of variation in spread within the botanical garden and in forest establishment was explained by phylogeny alone than for other models. Phylogeny jointly with variables also explained a greater proportion of variation in forest establishment than in other models. Phylogenetic correction weakened the importance of dispersal syndrome in explaining compartmental spread, seed mass in the forest establishment model, and all factors except for growth rate and residence time in the naturalization model. 5. Synthesis. This study demonstrates that it matters considerably how invasive species are defined when trying to understand the relative ability of multiple variables to explain invasion success. By disentangling different invasion stages and using relatively objective criteria to assess species status, this study highlights that relatively simple models can help to explain why some alien plants are able to naturalize, spread and even establish in closed tropical forests.","Factors explaining alien plant invasion success in a tropical ecosystem differ at each stage of invasion [SEP] 1.

Inferring Process from Pattern in Plant Invasions: A Semimechanistic Model Incorporating Propagule Pressure and Environmental Factors,"Propagule pressure is intuitively a key factor in biological invasions: increased availability of propagules increases the chances of establishment, persistence, naturalization, and invasion. The role of propagule pressure relative to disturbance and various environmental factors is, however, difficult to quantify. We explored the relative importance of factors driving invasions using detailed data on the distribution and percentage cover of alien tree species on South Africa's Agulhas Plain (2,160 km(2)). Classification trees based on geology, climate, land use, and topography adequately explained distribution but not abundance (canopy cover) of three widespread invasive species (Acacia cyclops, Acacia saligna, and Pinus pinaster). A semimechanistic model was then developed to quantify the roles of propagule pressure and environmental heterogeneity in structuring invasion patterns. The intensity of propagule pressure (approximated by the distance from putative invasion foci) was a much better predictor of canopy cover than any environmental factor that was considered. The influence of environmental factors was then assessed on the residuals of the first model to determine how propagule pressure interacts with environmental factors. The mediating effect of environmental factors was species specific. Models combining propagule pressure and environmental factors successfully predicted more than 70% of the variation in canopy cover for each species.","Inferring Process from Pattern in Plant Invasions: A Semimechanistic Model Incorporating Propagule Pressure and Environmental Factors [SEP] Propagule pressure is intuitively a key factor in biological invasions: increased availability of propagules increases the chances of establishment, persistence, naturalization, and invasion.

Passerine introductions to New Zealand support a positive effect of propagule pressure on establishment success,"There is growing consensus in the literature on biological invasions that propagule pressure (or a component thereof) is the primary determinant of establishment success in introduced species. However, a recent paper (Moulton et al. Biodiver Conserv 20:607-623, 2011) questions whether this consensus is justified. It argues that the effect of propagule pressure is not general because most of the evidence for it comes from analyses of historical bird data to New Zealand, and, moreover, that both the analyses and the data on which they are based are faulty. Moulton et al. (Biodiver Conserv 20:607-623, 2011) present a re-analysis that fails to find a relationship between establishment success and propagule pressure in New Zealand bird introductions.

Predicting invasions by woody species in a temperate zone: a test of three risk assessment schemes in the Czech Republic (Central Europe),"To assess the validity of previously developed risk assessment schemes in the conditions of Central Europe, we tested (1) Australian weed risk assessment scheme (WRA; Pheloung et al. 1999); (2) WRA with additional analysis by Daehler et al. (2004); and (3) decision tree scheme of Reichard and Hamilton (1997) developed in North America, on a data set of 180 alien woody species commonly planted in the Czech Republic. This list included 17 invasive species, 9 naturalized but non-invasive, 31 casual aliens, and 123 species not reported to escape from cultivation. The WRA model with additional analysis provided best results, rejecting 100% of invasive species, accepting 83.8% of non-invasive, and recommending further 13.0% for additional analysis. Overall accuracy of the WRA model with additional analysis was 85.5%, higher than that of the basic WRA scheme (67.9%) and the Reichard-Hamilton model (61.6%). Only the Reichard-Hamilton scheme accepted some invaders. The probability that an accepted species will become an invader was zero for both WRA models and 3.2% for the Reichard-Hamilton model. The probability that a rejected species would have been an invader was 77.3% for both WRA models and 24.0% for the Reichard-Hamilton model. It is concluded that the WRA model, especially with additional analysis, appears to be a promising template for building a widely applicable system for screening out invasive plant introductions.","Predicting invasions by woody species in a temperate zone: a test of three risk assessment schemes in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) [SEP] To assess the validity of previously developed risk assessment schemes in the conditions of Central Europe, we tested (1) Australian weed risk assessment scheme (WRA; Pheloung et al. 1999); (2) WRA with additional analysis by Daehler et al.

Residence time and human-mediated propagule pressure at work in the alien flora of Galapagos,"Introduced species present the greatest threat to the unique terrestrial biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands. We assess the current status of plant invasion in Galapagos, predict the likelihood of future naturalizations and invasions from the existing introduced flora, and suggest measures to help limit future invasions. There has been a 1.46 fold increase in plant biodiversity in Galapagos due to alien plant naturalizations, reflecting a similar trend on islands elsewhere. There are 870 alien plant species recorded in the archipelago. Of evaluated species, 34% species have naturalized. Within this group are the invasive species (16% of evaluated) and the transformers (3.3% of evaluated). We show that, as expected, naturalized species have been present in the archipelago longer than non-naturalized species. We also find that a higher human-mediated propagule pressure is associated with a greater human population and with properties that have been settled longer. This, combined with the relatively recent introduction of most species, leads us to the conclusion that Galapagos is at an early stage of plant invasion. We predict that more species from the existing alien flora will find an opportunity to naturalize and invade as propagule pressure increases alongside rapid human population growth associated with immigration to serve the booming tourism industry. In order to reduce future invasion risk, we suggest reviewing inter-island quarantine measures and continuing community education efforts to reduce human-mediated propagule pressure.","Residence time and human-mediated propagule pressure at work in the alien flora of Galapagos [SEP] Introduced species present the greatest threat to the unique terrestrial biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands.

Colonization Success in Roesel's Bush-Cricket Metrioptera roeseli: The Effects of Propagule Size,"Assessing the colonizing ability of a species is important for predicting its future distribution or for planning the introduction or reintroduction of that species for conservation purposes. The best way to assess colonizing ability is by making experimental introductions of the species and monitoring the outcome. In this study, different-sized propagules of Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeseli, were experimentally introduced into 70 habitat islands, previously uninhabited by the species, in farmland fields in southeastern Sweden. The areas of introduction were carefully monitored for 2-3 yr to determine whether the propagules had successfully colonized the patches. The study showed that large propagules resulted in larger local populations during the years following introduction. Probability of colonization for each propagule size was measured and showed that propagule size had a significant effect on colonization success, i.e., large propagules were more successful in colonizing new patches. If future introductions were to be made with this or a similar species, a propagule size of at least 32 individuals would be required to establish a viable population with a high degree of certainty.","Colonization Success in Roesel's Bush-Cricket Metrioptera roeseli: The Effects of Propagule Size [SEP] Assessing the colonizing ability of a species is important for predicting its future distribution or for planning the introduction or reintroduction of that species for conservation purposes.

"Population structure, propagule pressure, and conservation biogeography in the sub-Antarctic: lessons from indigenous and invasive springtails","The patterns in and the processes underlying the distribution of invertebrates among Southern Ocean islands and across vegetation types on these islands are reasonably well understood. However, few studies have examined the extent to which populations are genetically structured. Given that many sub-Antarctic islands experienced major glaciation and volcanic activity, it might be predicted that substantial population substructure and little genetic isolation-by-distance should characterize indigenous species. By contrast, substantially less population structure might be expected for introduced species. Here, we examine these predictions and their consequences for the conservation of diversity in the region. We do so by examining haplotype diversity based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data, from two indigenous (Cryptopygus antarcticus travei, Tullbergia bisetosa) and two introduced (Isotomurus cf. palustris, Ceratophysella denticulata) springtail species from Marion Island. We find considerable genetic substructure in the indigenous species that is compatible with the geological and glacialogical history of the island. Moreover, by employing ecological techniques, we show that haplotype diversity is likely much higher than our sequenced samples suggest. No structure is found in the introduced species, with each being represented by a single haplotype only. This indicates that propagule pressure is not significant for these small animals unlike the situation for other, larger invasive species: a few individuals introduced once are likely to have initiated the invasion. These outcomes demonstrate that sampling must be more comprehensive if the population history of indigenous arthropods on these islands is to be comprehended, and that the risks of within- and among-island introductions are substantial. The latter means that, if biogeographical signal is to be retained in the region, great care must be taken to avoid inadvertent movement of indigenous species among and within islands. Thus, quarantine procedures should also focus on among-island movements.","Population structure, propagule pressure, and conservation biogeography in the sub-Antarctic: lessons from indigenous and invasive springtails [SEP] The patterns in and the processes underlying the distribution of invertebrates among Southern Ocean islands and across vegetation types on these islands are reasonably well understood.

We do so by examining haplotype diversity based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data, from two indigenous (Cryptopygus antarcticus travei, Tullbergia bisetosa) and two introduced (Isotomurus cf. palustris, Ceratophysella denticulata) springtail species from Marion Island. We find considerable genetic substructure in the indigenous species that is compatible with the geological and glacialogical history of the island. Moreover, by employing ecological techniques, we show that haplotype diversity is likely much higher than our sequenced samples suggest. No structure is found in the introduced species, with each being represented by a single haplotype only. This indicates that propagule pressure is not significant for these small animals unlike the situation for other, larger invasive species: a few individuals introduced once are likely to have initiated the invasion. These outcomes demonstrate that sampling must be more comprehensive if the population history of indigenous arthropods on these islands is to be comprehended, and that the risks of within- and among-island introductions are substantial. The latter means that, if biogeographical signal is to be retained in the region, great care must be taken to avoid inadvertent movement of indigenous species among and within islands. Thus, quarantine procedures should also focus on among-island movements.","6-0,6-3",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The demography of introduction pathways, propagule pressure and occurrences of non-native freshwater fish in England","1. Biological invasion theory predicts that the introduction and establishment of non-native species is positively correlated with propagule pressure. Releases of pet and aquarium fishes to inland waters has a long history; however, few studies have examined the demographic basis of their importation and incidence in the wild. 2. For the 1500 grid squares (10 x 10 km) that make up England, data on human demographics (population density, numbers of pet shops, garden centres and fish farms), the numbers of non-native freshwater fishes (from consented licences) imported in those grid squares (i.e. propagule pressure), and the reported incidences (in a national database) of non-native fishes in the wild were used to examine spatial relationships between the occurrence of non-native fishes and the demographic factors associated with propagule pressure, as well as to test whether the demographic factors are statistically reliable predictors of the incidence of non-native fishes, and as such surrogate estimators of propagule pressure. 3. Principal coordinates of neighbour matrices analyses, used to generate spatially explicit models, and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that spatial distributions of non-native species in England were significantly related to human population density, garden centre density and fish farm density. Human population density and the number of fish imports were identified as the best predictors of propagule pressure. 4. Human population density is an effective surrogate estimator of non-native fish propagule pressure and can be used to predict likely areas of non-native fish introductions. In conjunction with fish movements, where available, human population densities can be used to support biological invasion monitoring programmes across Europe (and perhaps globally) and to inform management decisions as regards the prioritization of areas for the control of non-native fish introductions.

"Succession of floodplain grasslands following reduction in land use intensity: the importance of environmental conditions, management and dispersal","Classical ecological theory predicts a succession towards plant communities that are determined by environmental conditions. However, in ecological restoration, species composition often remains different from the predicted target community, compromising the success of restoration measures. We analysed the relative importance of environmental conditions, management and distance to source populations for floodplain grassland succession following re-conversion from intensive to traditional use. The study was established at 33 grassland sites in central German river valleys. Species composition, environmental variables, past and current management, and the distance to source populations of characteristic species of traditional management (indicator species) were recorded and compared using multivariate statistics. We further tested the speed of colonization by two indicator species, Silaum silaus and Serratula tinctoria, along transects from source populations into unoccupied fields. The species composition of the successional grassland was mainly determined by elevation, total soil nitrogen, distance to remnant species-rich grasslands and frequency of mowing or grazing. Elevation and distance were negatively, and frequency was positively related to the occurrence of late successional species. Colonization by indicator species was only dependent on the distance to source populations; other explanatory variables were not significant. Migration from adjacent source sites of S. silaus and S. tinctoria into re-converted grasslands was slow, reaching only 40 m and 15 m after 15 years. Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrated the limitations of the deterministic view on plant succession and the high relative importance of propagule availability in grassland restoration. Natural colonization will only be successful if source populations of the target species are adjacent to the restoration sites. Artificial introduction techniques are recommended to overcome dispersal barriers.","Succession of floodplain grasslands following reduction in land use intensity: the importance of environmental conditions, management and dispersal [SEP] Classical ecological theory predicts a succession towards plant communities that are determined by environmental conditions.

The comparative importance of species traits and introduction characteristics in tropical plant invasions,"Aim We used alien plant species introduced to a botanic garden to investigate the relative importance of species traits (leaf traits, dispersal syndrome) and introduction characteristics (propagule pressure, residence time and distance to forest) in explaining establishment success in surrounding tropical forest. We also used invasion scores from a weed risk assessment protocol as an independent measure of invasion risk and assessed differences in variables between high- and low-risk species. Location East Usambara mountains, Tanzania. Methods Forest transect surveys identified species establishing in disturbed and intact forest. Leaf traits (specific leaf area and foliar nutrient concentrations) were measured from leaves sampled in high-light environments. Results A leaf traits spectrum was apparent, but species succeeding or failing to establish in either disturbed or intact forest were not located in different parts of the spectrum. Species with high invasion risk did not differ in their location on the leaf trait spectrum compared with low-risk species but were more likely to be bird/primate-dispersed. For 15 species establishing in forest quadrats, median canopy cover of quadrats where seedlings were present was correlated with a species value along the leaf trait spectrum. Species establishing in disturbed forest were planted in twice as many plantations and were marginally more likely to be bird- or primate-dispersed than species failing to become established in disturbed forest. Establishment in intact forest was more likely for species planted closer to forest edges. Main conclusions Leaf and dispersal traits appear less important in the colonization of tropical forest than introduction characteristics. It appears, given sufficient propagule pressure or proximity to forest, alien species are much more likely to establish independently of leaf traits or dispersal syndrome in continental tropical forests.","The comparative importance of species traits and introduction characteristics in tropical plant invasions [SEP] Aim We used alien plant species introduced to a botanic garden to investigate the relative importance of species traits (leaf traits, dispersal syndrome) and introduction characteristics (propagule pressure, residence time and distance to forest) in explaining establishment success in surrounding tropical forest.

Propagule pressure as a driver of establishment success in deliberately introduced exotic species: fact or artefact?,"A central paradigm in invasion biology is that more releases of higher numbers of individuals increase the likelihood that an exotic population successfully establishes and persists. Recently, however, it has been suggested that, in cases where the data are sourced from historical records of purposefully released species, the direction of causality is reversed, and that initial success leads to higher numbers being released. Here, we explore the implications of this alternative hypothesis, and derive six a priori predictions from it. We test these predictions using data on Acclimatization Society introductions of passerine bird species to New Zealand, which have previously been used to support both hypotheses for the direction of causality. All our predictions are falsified. This study reaffirms that the conventional paradigm in invasion biology is indeed the correct one for New Zealand passerine bird introductions, for which numbers released determine establishment success. Our predictions are not restricted to this fauna, however, and we keenly anticipate their application to other suitable datasets.","Propagule pressure as a driver of establishment success in deliberately introduced exotic species: fact or artefact?

Propagule pressure hypothesis not supported by an 80-year experiment on woody species invasion,"Ecological filters and availability of propagules play key roles structuring natural communities. Propagule pressure has recently been suggested to be a fundamental factor explaining the success or failure of biological introductions. We tested this hypothesis with a remarkable data set on trees introduced to Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina. More than 130 species of woody plants, many known to be highly invasive elsewhere, were introduced to this island early in the 20th century, as part of an experiment to test their suitability as commercial forestry trees for this region. We obtained detailed data on three estimates of propagule pressure (number of introduced individuals, number of areas where introduced, and number of years during which the species was planted) for 18 exotic woody species. We matched these data with a survey of the species and number of individuals currently invading the island. None of the three estimates of propagule pressure predicted the current pattern of invasion. We suggest that other factors, such as biotic resistance, may be operating to determine the observed pattern of invasion, and that propagule pressure may play a relatively minor role in explaining at least some observed patterns of invasion success and failure.","Propagule pressure hypothesis not supported by an 80-year experiment on woody species invasion [SEP] Ecological filters and availability of propagules play key roles structuring natural communities.

Over 1500 Scolytinae interceptions were recorded at New Zealand's borders between 1950 and 2000. Among the 103 species were Dendroctonus ponderosae, lps typogrciphus, and other high-risk species, but actual arrivals probably included many more species. Interceptions were primarily associated with dunnage, casewood (crating), and sawn timber, and originated from 59 countries, mainly from Europe, Australasia, northern Asia, and North America. New Zealand and United States interception data were highly correlated, and 7 of the 10 most intercepted species were shared. Interception frequency and establishment in New Zealand were not clearly related. By combining New Zealand and United States interceptions of true bark beetles we obtained data on species found in shipments from around the world. Logistic regression analysis showed that frequently intercepted species were about four times as likely as rarely intercepted species to be established somewhere. Interception records of wood and bark borers are valuable for the prediction of invaders and for our general understanding of invasions. The use of alternatives to solid wood packaging, Such as processed wood, should be encouraged to reduce the spread of invasive wood and bark borers.","Interception frequency of exotic bark and ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) and relationship with establishment in New Zealand and worldwide [SEP] Scolytinae species are among the most damaging forest pests, and many of them are invasive.

The Influence of Numbers Released on the Outcome of Attempts to Introduce Exotic Bird Species to New Zealand,"1. Information on the approximate number of individuals released is available for 47 of the 133 exotic bird species introduced to New Zealand in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Of these, 21 species had populations surviving in the wild in 1969-79. The long interval between introduction and assessment of outcome provides a rare opportunity to examine the factors correlated with successful establishment without the uncertainty of long-term population persistence associated with studies of short duration. 2. The probability of successful establishment was strongly influenced by the number of individuals released during the main period of introductions. Eight-three per cent of species that had more than 100 individuals released within a 10-year period became established, compared with 21% of species that had less than 100 birds released. The relationship between the probability of establishment and number of birds released was similar to that found in a previous study of introductions of exotic birds to Australia. 3. It was possible to look for a within-family influence on the success of introduction of the number of birds released in nine bird families. A positive influence was found within seven families and nd effect in two families. This preponderance of families with a positive effect was statistically significant. 4. A significant effect of body weight on the probability of successful establishment was found, and negative effects of clutch size and latitude of origin. However, the statistical significance of these effects varied according to whether comparison was or was not restricted to within-family variation. After applying the Bonferroni adjustment to significance levels, to allow for the large number of variables and factors being considered, only the effect of the number of birds released was statistically significant. 5. No significant effects on the probability of successful establishment were apparent for the mean date of release, the minimum number of years in which birds were released, the hemisphere of origin (northern or southern) and the size and diversity of latitudinal distribution of the natural geographical range.","The Influence of Numbers Released on the Outcome of Attempts to Introduce Exotic Bird Species to New Zealand [SEP] 1.

Differentiating successful and failed molluscan invaders in estuarine ecosystems,"Despite mounting evidence of invasive species'impacts on the environment and society, our ability to predict invasion establishment, spread, and impact are inadequate. Efforts to explain and predict invasion outcomes have been limited primarily to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Invasions are also common in coastal marine ecosystems, yet to date predictive marine invasion models are absent. Here we present a model based on biological attributes associated with invasion success (establishment) of marine molluscs that compares successful and failed invasions from a group of 93 species introduced to San Francisco Bay (SFB) in association with commercial oyster transfers from eastern North America (ca. 1869 to 1940). A multiple logistic regression model correctly classified 83% of successful and 80 % of failed invaders according to their source region abundance at the time of oyster transfers, tolerance of low salinity, and developmental mode. We tested the generality of the SFB invasion model by applying it to 3 coastal locations (2 in North America and 1 in Europe) that received oyster transfers from the same source and during the same time as SFB. The model correctly predicted 100, 75, and 86 % of successful invaders in these locations, indicating that abundance, environmental tolerance (ability to withstand low salinity), and developmental mode not only explain patterns of invasion success in SFB, but more importantly, predict invasion success in geographically disparate marine ecosystems. Finally, we demonstrate that the proportion of marine molluscs that succeeded in the latter stages of invasion (i.e. that establish self-sustaining populations, spread and become pests) is much greater than has been previously predicted or shown for other animals and plants.","Differentiating successful and failed molluscan invaders in estuarine ecosystems [SEP] Despite mounting evidence of invasive species'impacts on the environment and society, our ability to predict invasion establishment, spread, and impact are inadequate.

Methods We use a high quality data set on biological introductions of parrots (Aves: Psittaciformes). These data allow us to examine relationships between life history traits and probability of successful transition through an introduction stage when the species pool is both correctly and incorrectly specified. Results For the establishment of introduced parrot species, nearly half of the predictor variables showed different patterns of significance when an incorrect pool was specified. Multivariate analysis identified entirely different sets of variables as independent predictors of establishment success, depending on the species pool used. Correct pool specification identified that introduced parrot species have been more likely to establish if they have broader diets and are more sedentary. Main conclusions Conclusions from the analysis of biological introductions are likely to depend on the specification of the species pool for such analyses. In the analysis of parrot introductions, this was particularly apparent in establishment success following release.

"Extinction, survival, and effects of birds introduced to the Mascarenes","At least 20 passeriform bird species have been introduced to the Mascarene Archipelago; 11 survive. These species are largely allotopic with native passeriforms, and there is no compelling evidence for resource competition between the two groups. Some invaders rob nests of endemics but this phenomenon seems not to threaten existence. Threats to the native birds are most likely anthropogenous, including habitat modification. The introduced species generally either survived on all the islands to which they have been introduced or failed on all. Some of these extinctions may have been due to demographic stochasticity and to hunting. Most introduced species that have survived in the Mascarenes have been introduced to many other locations worldwide and have survived in most of them. Trajectories of three introduced species are puzzling: all three thrived on La Reunion and Mauritius, then dwindled to extinction on Maritius and, for one or two of these species, on La Reunion as well. -from Author","Extinction, survival, and effects of birds introduced to the Mascarenes [SEP] At least 20 passeriform bird species have been introduced to the Mascarene Archipelago; 11 survive.

Marketing time predicts naturalization of horticultural plants,"Horticulture is an important source of naturalized plants, but our knowledge about naturalization frequencies and potential patterns of naturalization in horticultural plants is limited. We analyzed a unique set of data derived from the detailed sales catalogs (1887-1930) of the most important early Florida, USA, plant nursery (Royal Palm Nursery) to detect naturalization patterns of these horticultural plants in the state. Of the 1903 nonnative species sold by the nursery, 15% naturalized. The probability of plants becoming naturalized increases significantly with the number of years the plants were marketed. Plants that became invasive and naturalized were sold for an average of 19.6 and 14.8 years, respectively, compared to 6.8 years for non-naturalized plants, and the naturalization of plants sold for 30 years or more is 70%. Unexpectedly, plants that were sold earlier were less likely to naturalize than those sold later. The nursery's inexperience, which caused them to grow and market many plants unsuited to Florida during their early period, may account for this pattern. Plants with pantropical distributions and those native to both Africa and Asia were more likely to naturalize (42%), than were plants native to other smaller regions, suggesting that plants with large native ranges were more likely to naturalize. Naturalization percentages also differed according to plant life form, with the most naturalization occurring in aquatic herbs (36.8%) and vines (30.8%). Plants belonging to the families Araceae, Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Moraceae, Oleaceae, and Verbenaceae had higher than expected naturalization. Information theoretic model selection indicated that the number of years a plant was sold, alone or together with the first year a plant was sold, was the strongest predictor of naturalization. Because continued importation and marketing of nonnative horticultural plants will lead to additional plant naturalization and invasion, a comprehensive approach to address this problem, including research to identify and select noninvasive forms and types of horticultural plants is urgently needed.","Marketing time predicts naturalization of horticultural plants [SEP] Horticulture is an important source of naturalized plants, but our knowledge about naturalization frequencies and potential patterns of naturalization in horticultural plants is limited. We analyzed a unique set of data derived from the detailed sales catalogs (1887-1930) of the most important early Florida, USA, plant nursery (Royal Palm Nursery) to detect naturalization patterns of these horticultural plants in the state. Of the 1903 nonnative species sold by the nursery, 15% naturalized. The probability of plants becoming naturalized increases significantly with the number of years the plants were marketed. Plants that became invasive and naturalized were sold for an average of 19.6 and 14.8 years, respectively, compared to 6.8 years for non-naturalized plants, and the naturalization of plants sold for 30 years or more is 70%. Unexpectedly, plants that were sold earlier were less likely to naturalize than those sold later. The nursery's inexperience, which caused them to grow and market many plants unsuited to Florida during their early period, may account for this pattern. Plants with pantropical distributions and those native to both Africa and Asia were more likely to naturalize (42%), than were plants native to other smaller regions, suggesting that plants with large native ranges were more likely to naturalize. Naturalization percentages also differed according to plant life form, with the most naturalization occurring in aquatic herbs (36.8%) and vines (30.8%). Plants belonging to the families Araceae, Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Moraceae, Oleaceae, and Verbenaceae had higher than expected naturalization. Information theoretic model selection indicated that the number of years a plant was sold, alone or together with the first year a plant was sold, was the strongest predictor of naturalization.

Ecological predictions and risk assessment for alien fishes in North America,"Methods of risk assessment for alien species, especially for nonagricultural systems, are largely qualitative. Using a generalizable risk assessment approach and statistical models of fish introductions into the Great Lakes, North America, we developed a quantitative approach to target prevention efforts on species most likely to cause damage. Models correctly categorized established, quickly spreading, and nuisance fishes with 87 to 94% accuracy. We then identified fishes that pose a high risk to the Great Lakes if introduced from unintentional ( ballast water) or intentional pathways ( sport, pet, bait, and aquaculture industries).","Ecological predictions and risk assessment for alien fishes in North America [SEP] Methods of risk assessment for alien species, especially for nonagricultural systems, are largely qualitative.
