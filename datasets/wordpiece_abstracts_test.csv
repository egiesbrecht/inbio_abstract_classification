"Diversity patterns of small mammals in the Zambales Mts., Luzon, Philippines","In 2004 and 2005, we conducted a survey of the small mammals on Mt. Tapulao ( = Mt. High Peak, 2037 m) in the Zambales Mountains, Luzon Island, Philippines in order to obtain the first information on the mammals of this newly discovered center of endemism. We also tested two hypotheses regarding the relationship of species richness with elevation and the impact of alien species on native mammals. The survey covered five localities representing habitats from regenerating lowland rain forest at 860 in to mossy rain forest near the peak at 2024 in. We recorded 11 species, including 1 native shrew, 1 alien shrew, 8 native rodents, and 1 alien rodent. Two species of Apomys and one species of Rhynchomys are endemic to Zambales; this establishes the Zambales Mountains as a significant center of mammalian endemism. Species richness of native small mammals increased with elevation, from five species in the lowlands at 925 in to seven species in mossy forest at 2024 m; total relative abundance of native small mammals increased from 925 to 1690 m, then declined at 2024 in. Alien small mammals were restricted to highly disturbed areas. Our results support the prediction that maximum species richness of small mammals would occur in lower mossy forest near the peak, not near the center of the gradient. Our results also support the hypothesis that when a diverse community of native Philippine small mammals is present in either old-growth or disturbed forest habitat, ""Invasive"" alien species are unable to penetrate and maintain significant populations in forest.

Population regulation by enemies of the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum: demography in native and invaded ranges,"The enemy-release hypothesis (ERH) states that species become more successful in their introduced range than in their native range because they leave behind natural enemies in their native range and are thus ""released"" from enemy pressures in their introduced range. The ERH is popularly cited to explain the invasive properties of many species and is the underpinning of biological control. We tested the prediction that plant populations are more strongly regulated by natural enemies (herbivores and pathogens) in their native range than in their introduced range with enemy-removal experiments using pesticides. These experiments were replicated at multiple sites in both the native and invaded ranges of the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum. In support of the ERH, enemies consistently regulated populations in the native range. There were more tillers and more seeds produced in treated vs. untreated plots in the native range, and few seedlings survived in the native range. Contrary to the ERH, total measured leaf damage was similar in both ranges, though the enemies that caused it differed. There was more damage by generalist mollusks and pathogens in the native range, and more damage by generalist insect herbivores in the invaded range. Demographic analysis showed that population growth rates were lower in the native range than in the invaded range, and that sexually produced seedlings constituted a smaller fraction of the total in the native range. Our removal experiment showed that enemies regulate plant populations in their native range and suggest that generalist enemies, not just specialists, are important for population regulation.","Population regulation by enemies of the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum: demography in native and invaded ranges [SEP] The enemy-release hypothesis (ERH) states that species become more successful in their introduced range than in their native range because they leave behind natural enemies in their native range and are thus ""released"" from enemy pressures in their introduced range.

Predicting spatial extent of invasive earthworms on an oceanic island,"Aim Invasions of non-native earthworms into previously earthworm-free regions are a major conservation concern because they alter ecosystems and threaten biological diversity. Little information is available, however, about effects of earthworm invasions outside of temperate and boreal forests, particularly about invasions of islands. For San Clemente Island (SCI), California (USA) - an oceanic island with numerous endemic and endangered plant and vertebrate species - we assessed the spatial extent and drivers of earthworm invasion and examined relationships between earthworms and plant and soil microbial communities. Location San Clemente Island, southern California, USA. Methods Using a stratified random sampling approach, we sampled earthworms, vegetation, soils and microbial communities across SCI. We examined the relationship between the presence of invasive earthworms and soil and landscape variables using logistic regression models and implemented a spatial representation of the best model to represent potential site suitability for earthworms. We evaluated the relationship between invasive earthworms and vegetation and microbial variables using ANOVA. Results We found that the likelihood of encountering earthworms increased close to roads and streams and in high moisture conditions, which correspond to higher elevation and a north-eastern aspect on SCI. The presence of earthworms was positively associated with total ground vegetation cover, grass cover and non-native plant cover; however, there was no significant relationship between earthworms and microbial biomass. These results suggest that the earthworm invasion on SCI is at an early stage and closely tied to roads and high moisture conditions. Main conclusions Climatic variables and potential sources of earthworm introduction and dispersal (e.g. roads and streams) should be broadly useful for predicting current and future sites of earthworm invasions on both islands and continents. Furthermore, the significant positive relationship between non-native plant cover and invasive earthworm presence raises the possibility of an emerging invasional 'meltdown' on SCI. Additional study of earthworm invasions on human-inhabited oceanic islands is necessary to identify additional invasions and their potential for negative impacts on unique insular biota.","Predicting spatial extent of invasive earthworms on an oceanic island [SEP] Aim Invasions of non-native earthworms into previously earthworm-free regions are a major conservation concern because they alter ecosystems and threaten biological diversity.

Predator-driven biotic resistance and propagule pressure regulate the invasive apple snail Pomacea canaliculata in Japan,"Species richness in local communities has been considered an important factor determining the success of invasion by exotic species (the biotic resistance hypothesis). However, the detailed mechanisms, especially the role of predator communities, are not well understood. We studied biotic resistance to an invasive freshwater snail, Pomacea canaliculata, at 31 sites in an urban river basin (the Yamatogawa) in western Japan. First, we studied the relationship between the richness of local animal species and the abundance of P. canaliculata, demonstrating a negative relationship, which suggests that the intensity of biotic resistance regulates local snail populations. This pattern was due to the richness of native predator communities rather than that of introduced species or non-predators (mainly competitors of the apple snail). Local snail abundance was also affected by immigration of snails from nearby rice fields (i.e. propagule pressure), where few predators occur. Second, we assessed short-term predation pressure on the snail by means of a tethering experiment. Predation pressure was positively correlated with the number of individual predators and negatively correlated with snail abundance. The introduced crayfish Procambarus clarkii was responsible for the variance in predation pressure. These results indicate that the predator community, composed of both native and introduced species, is responsible for resistance to a novel invader even in a polluted urban river.","Predator-driven biotic resistance and propagule pressure regulate the invasive apple snail Pomacea canaliculata in Japan [SEP] Species richness in local communities has been considered an important factor determining the success of invasion by exotic species (the biotic resistance hypothesis).

"The rich generally get richer, but there are exceptions: Correlations between species richness of native plant species and alien weeds in Mexico","Studies on the resistance of communities to plant invasions at different spatial scales have yielded contradictory results that have been attributed to scale-dependent factors. Some of these studies argue either for or against Elton's notion of biotic resistance against invasions through diversity. We studied the correlation between alien weeds and native species, dividing the latter group into weedy and non-weedy species, integrating various factors that influence diversity into an analysis on the scale of the federal states of Mexico. The resulting multiple-regression models for native and alien weed species are robust (adjusted R-2 = 0.87 and R-2 = 0.69, respectively) and show a strong partial correlation of the number of weed species (native and alien) with the number of non-weed native species. These results agree with studies showing a positive correlation between the number of native and alien species on larger scales. Both models also include human population density as an important predictor variable, but this is more important for alien weeds (beta = 0.62) than for native weeds (beta = 0.32). In the regression model for native weed species richness, the non-cultivated (fallow) area (beta = 0.24) correlated positively with native weed richness. In the model for alien weed species richness, the native weed species richness was an important variable (beta = -0.51), showing a negative partial correlation (r(part) = -0.4). This result is consistent with Elton's biotic resistance hypothesis, suggesting that biotic resistance is scale independent but that this may be masked by other factors that influence the diversity of both weeds and non-weeds.","The rich generally get richer, but there are exceptions: Correlations between species richness of native plant species and alien weeds in Mexico [SEP] Studies on the resistance of communities to plant invasions at different spatial scales have yielded contradictory results that have been attributed to scale-dependent factors.

Positive diversity-invasibility relationship in species-rich semi-natural grassland at the neighbourhood scale,"Background and Aims Attempts to answer the old question of whether high diversity causes high invasion resistance have resulted in an invasion paradox: while large-scale studies often find a positive relationship between diversity and invasibility, small-scale experimental studies often find a negative relationship. Many of the small-scale studies are conducted in artificial communities of even-aged plants. Species in natural communities, however, do not represent one simultaneous cohort and occur at various levels of spatial aggregation at different scales. This study used natural patterns of diversity to assess the relationship between diversity and invasibility within a uniformly managed, semi-natural community. Methods In species-rich grassland, one seed of each of ten species was added to each of 50 contiguous 16 cm(2) quadrats within seven plots (8 x 100 cm). The emergence of these species was recorded in seven control plots, and establishment success was measured in relation to the species diversity of the resident vegetation at two spatial scales, quadrat (64 cm(2)) within plots (800 cm(2)) and between plots within the site (approx. 400 m(2)) over 46 months. Key Results Invader success was positively related to resident species diversity and richness over a range of 28-37 species per plot. This relationship emerged 7 months after seed addition and remained over time despite continuous mortality of invaders. Conclusions Biotic resistance to plant invasion may play only a sub-ordinate role in species-rich, semi-natural grassland. As possible alternative explanations for the positive diversity-invasibility relationship are not clear, it is recommended that future studies elaborate fine-scale environmental heterogeneity in resource supplies or potential resource flows from resident species to seedlings by means of soil biological networks established by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","Positive diversity-invasibility relationship in species-rich semi-natural grassland at the neighbourhood scale [SEP] Background and Aims Attempts to answer the old question of whether high diversity causes high invasion resistance have resulted in an invasion paradox: while large-scale studies often find a positive relationship between diversity and invasibility, small-scale experimental studies often find a negative relationship.

Environmental and biotic correlates to lionfish invasion success in Bahamian coral reefs,"Lionfish (Pterois volitans), venomous predators from the Indo-Pacific, are recent invaders of the Caribbean Basin and southeastern coast of North America. Quantification of invasive lionfish abundances, along with potentially important physical and biological environmental characteristics, permitted inferences about the invasion process of reefs on the island of San Salvador in the Bahamas. Environmental wave-exposure had a large influence on lionfish abundance, which was more than 20 and 120 times greater for density and biomass respectively at sheltered sites as compared with wave-exposed environments. Our measurements of topographic complexity of the reefs revealed that lionfish abundance was not driven by habitat rugosity. Lionfish abundance was not negatively affected by the abundance of large native predators (or large native groupers) and was also unrelated to the abundance of medium prey fishes (total length of 5-10 cm). These relationships suggest that (1) higher-energy environments may impose intrinsic resistance against lionfish invasion, (2) habitat complexity may not facilitate the lionfish invasion process, (3) predation or competition by native fishes may not provide biotic resistance against lionfish invasion, and (4) abundant prey fish might not facilitate lionfish invasion success. The relatively low biomass of large grouper on this island could explain our failure to detect suppression of lionfish abundance and we encourage continuing the preservation and restoration of potential lionfish predators in the Caribbean. In addition, energetic environments might exert direct or indirect resistance to the lionfish proliferation, providing native fish populations with essential refuges.","Environmental and biotic correlates to lionfish invasion success in Bahamian coral reefs [SEP] Lionfish (Pterois volitans), venomous predators from the Indo-Pacific, are recent invaders of the Caribbean Basin and southeastern coast of North America.

Native plant diversity resists invasion at both low and high resource levels,"Human modi. cation of the environment is causing both loss of species and changes in resource availability. While studies have examined how species loss at the local level can influence invasion resistance, interactions between species loss and other components of environmental change remain poorly studied. In particular, the manner in which native diversity interacts with resource availability to influence invasion resistance is not well understood. We created experimental plant assemblages that varied in native species (1-16 species) and/or functional richness (defined by rooting morphology and phenology; one to five functional groups). We crossed these diversity treatments with resource ( water) addition to determine their interactive effects on invasion resistance to spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), a potent exotic invader in the intermountain West of the United States. We also determined how native diversity and resource addition influenced plant-available soil nitrogen, soil moisture, and light. Assemblages with lower species and functional diversity were more heavily invaded than assemblages with greater species and functional diversity. In uninvaded assemblages, experimental addition of water increased soil moisture and plant-available nitrogen and decreased light availability. The availability of these resources generally declined with increasing native plant diversity. Although water addition increased susceptibility to invasion, it did not fundamentally change the negative relationship between diversity and invasibility. Thus, native diversity provided strong invasion resistance even under high resource availability. These results suggest that the effects of local diversity can remain robust despite enhanced resource levels that are predicted under scenarios of global change.","Native plant diversity resists invasion at both low and high resource levels [SEP] Human modi. cation of the environment is causing both loss of species and changes in resource availability.

Landscape-scale patterns of biological invasions in shoreline plant communities,"Little is known about the patterns and dynamics of exotic species invasions at landscape to regional spatial scales. We quantified the presence (identity, abundance, and richness) and characteristics of native and exotic species in estuarine strandline plant communities at 24 sites in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. Our results do not support several fundamental predictions of invasion biology. Established exotics (79 of 147 recorded plant species) were nearly indistinguishable from the native plant species (i.e. in terms of growth form, taxonomic grouping, and patterns of spatial distribution and abundance) and essentially represent a random sub-set of the current regional species pool. The cover and richness of exotic species varied substantially among quadrats and sites but were not strongly related to any site-level physical characteristics thought to affect invasibility (i.e. the physical disturbance regime, legal status, neighboring habitat type, and substrate characteristics). Native and exotic cover or richness were not negatively related within most sites. Across sites, native and exotic richness were positively correlated and exotic cover was unrelated to native richness. The colonization and spread of exotics does not appear to have been substantially reduced at sites with high native diversity. Furthermore, despite the fact that the Rhode Island strandline system is one of the most highly-invaded natural plant communities described to date, exotic species, both individually and as a group, currently appear to pose little threat to native plant diversity. Our findings are concordant with most recent, large-scale investigations that do not support the theoretical foundation of invasion biology and generally contradict small-scale experimental work.","Landscape-scale patterns of biological invasions in shoreline plant communities [SEP] Little is known about the patterns and dynamics of exotic species invasions at landscape to regional spatial scales.

Ecological resistance to biological invasion overwhelmed by propagule pressure,"Models and observational studies have sought patterns of predictability for invasion of natural areas by nonindigenous species, but with limited success. In a field experiment using forest understory plants, we jointly manipulated three hypothesized determinants of biological invasion outcome: resident diversity, physical disturbance and abiotic conditions, and propagule pressure. The foremost constraints on net habitat invasibility were the number of propagules that arrived at a site and naturally varying resident plant density. The physical environment (flooding regime) and the number of established resident species had negligible impact on habitat invasibility as compared to propagule pressure, despite manipulations that forced a significant reduction in resident richness, and a gradient in flooding from no flooding to annual flooding. This is the first experimental study to demonstrate the primacy of propagule pressure as a determinant of habitat invasibility in comparison with other candidate controlling factors.","Ecological resistance to biological invasion overwhelmed by propagule pressure [SEP] Models and observational studies have sought patterns of predictability for invasion of natural areas by nonindigenous species, but with limited success.

Interactive effects of resource enrichment and resident diversity on invasion of native grassland by Lolium arundinaceum,"Resident diversity and resource enrichment are both recognized as potentially important determinants of community invasibility, but the effects of these biotic and abiotic factors on invasions are often investigated separately, and little work has been done to directly compare their relative effects or to examine their potential interactions. Here, we evaluate the individual and interactive effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment on plant community resistance to invasion. We factorially manipulated plant diversity and the enrichment of belowground (soil nitrogen) and aboveground (light) resources in low-fertility grassland communities invaded by Lolium arundinaceum, the most abundant invasive grass in eastern North America. Soil nitrogen enrichment enhanced L. arundinaceum performance, but increased resident diversity dampened this effect of nitrogen enrichment. Increased light availability (via clipping of aboveground vegetation) had a negligible effect on community invasibility. These results demonstrate that a community's susceptibility to invasion can be contingent upon the type of resource pulse and the diversity of resident species. In order to assess the generality of these results, future studies that test the effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment against a range of invasive species and in other environmental contexts (e.g., sites differing in soil fertility and light regimes) are needed. Such studies may help to resolve conflicting interpretations of the diversity-invasibility relationship and provide direction for management strategies.","Interactive effects of resource enrichment and resident diversity on invasion of native grassland by Lolium arundinaceum [SEP] Resident diversity and resource enrichment are both recognized as potentially important determinants of community invasibility, but the effects of these biotic and abiotic factors on invasions are often investigated separately, and little work has been done to directly compare their relative effects or to examine their potential interactions. Here, we evaluate the individual and interactive effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment on plant community resistance to invasion. We factorially manipulated plant diversity and the enrichment of belowground (soil nitrogen) and aboveground (light) resources in low-fertility grassland communities invaded by Lolium arundinaceum, the most abundant invasive grass in eastern North America. Soil nitrogen enrichment enhanced L. arundinaceum performance, but increased resident diversity dampened this effect of nitrogen enrichment. Increased light availability (via clipping of aboveground vegetation) had a negligible effect on community invasibility. These results demonstrate that a community's susceptibility to invasion can be contingent upon the type of resource pulse and the diversity of resident species. In order to assess the generality of these results, future studies that test the effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment against a range of invasive species and in other environmental contexts (e.g., sites differing in soil fertility and light regimes) are needed.

Continental rain forest fragments in Singapore resist invasion by exotic plants,"Aim In general, the plant communities of oceanic islands suffer more from exotic plant invasions than their continental equivalents. At least part of this difference may be contributed by differences in non-biological factors, such as the antiquity and intensity of human impacts and the absence of internal barriers to dispersal, rather than differences in inherent invasibility. We tested the resistance of species-rich continental rain forests to plant invasion on a small, continental island that has been subject to prolonged and intensive human impact. Location Singapore is a 683-km(2) equatorial island <1 km from the Asian mainland and with a population of 4 million people. It has a continental biota but has been subject to human impacts as intense as on any oceanic island. Methods We sampled twenty-nine sites in seven vegetation types, ranging from urban wasteland to fragments of primary lowland rain forest. In each sample plot, all plant species were identified, exotic cover was estimated, and a range of environmental variables measured. Additional qualitative surveys for exotic invasion were made in other forest areas in Singapore. The data were analysed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results The number of exotic species recorded at a site was unrelated to the number of native species. Across all sites, percentage canopy opening had the highest correlation with the number of exotic species, while soil pH (which largely reflects the incorporation of calcareous construction wastes) had the highest correlation if the mangrove sites were excluded. There were no exotics in mangrove forest and only a tropical American, bird-dispersed shrub, Clidemia hirta (L.) D. Don (Melastomataceae: Koster's Curse), in primary and tall secondary forest patches. The species-poor early stages of woody plant succession on highly degraded soils were also very resistant to exotic plant invasion. Main conclusions Long-isolated rain forest fragments in an exotic-dominated continental island landscape resist invasion by exotic plants, suggesting that the problems on oceanic islands may reflect an inherently greater invasibility. This study also adds to the increasing evidence that the floras of tropical rain forest fragments in South-east Asia are remarkably resilient on a time-scale of decades to a century or more.","Continental rain forest fragments in Singapore resist invasion by exotic plants [SEP] Aim In general, the plant communities of oceanic islands suffer more from exotic plant invasions than their continental equivalents.

Distributions of exotic plants in eastern Asia and North America,"Although some plant traits have been linked to invasion success, the possible effects of regional factors, such as diversity, habitat suitability, and human activity are not well understood. Each of these mechanisms predicts a different pattern of distribution at the regional scale. Thus, where climate and soils are similar, predictions based on regional hypotheses for invasion success can be tested by comparisons of distributions in the source and receiving regions. Here, we analyse the native and alien geographic ranges of all 1567 plant species that have been introduced between eastern Asia and North America or have been introduced to both regions from elsewhere. The results reveal correlations between the spread of exotics and both the native species richness and transportation networks of recipient regions. This suggests that both species interactions and human-aided dispersal influence exotic distributions, although further work on the relative importance of these processes is needed.","Distributions of exotic plants in eastern Asia and North America [SEP] Although some plant traits have been linked to invasion success, the possible effects of regional factors, such as diversity, habitat suitability, and human activity are not well understood.

"Habitat stress, species pool size and biotic resistance influence exotic plant richness in the Flooding Pampa grasslands","1. Theory and empirical evidence suggest that community invasibility is influenced by propagule pressure, physical stress and biotic resistance from resident species. We studied patterns of exotic and native species richness across the Flooding Pampas of Argentina, and tested for exotic richness correlates with major environmental gradients, species pool size, and native richness, among and within different grassland habitat types. 2. Native and exotic richness were positively correlated across grassland types, increasing from lowland meadows and halophyte steppes, through humid to mesophyte prairies in more elevated topographic positions. Species pool size was positively correlated with local richness of native and exotic plants, being larger for mesophyte and humid prairies. Localities in the more stressful meadow and halophyte steppe habitats contained smaller fractions of their landscape species pools. 3. Native and exotic species numbers decreased along a gradient of increasing soil salinity and decreasing soil depth, and displayed a unimodal relationship with soil organic carbon. When covarying habitat factors were held constant, exotic and native richness residuals were still positively correlated across sites. Within grassland habitat types, exotic and native species richness were positively associated in meadows and halophyte steppes but showed no consistent relationship in the least stressful, prairie habitat types. 4. Functional group composition differed widely between native and exotic species pools. Patterns suggesting biotic resistance to invasion emerged only within humid prairies, where exotic richness decreased with increasing richness of native warm-season grasses. This negative relationship was observed for other descriptors of invasion such as richness and cover of annual cool-season forbs, the commonest group of exotics. 5. Our results support the view that ecological factors correlated with differences in invasion success change with the range of environmental heterogeneity encompassed by the analysis. Within narrow habitat ranges, invasion resistance may be associated with either physical stress or resident native diversity. Biotic resistance through native richness, however, appeared to be effective only at intermediate locations along a stress/fertility gradient. 6. We show that certain functional groups, not just total native richness, may be critical to community resistance to invasion. Identifying such native species groups is important for directing management and conservation efforts.","Habitat stress, species pool size and biotic resistance influence exotic plant richness in the Flooding Pampa grasslands [SEP] 1.

Determinants of vertebrate invasion success in Europe and North America,"Species that are frequently introduced to an exotic range have a high potential of becoming invasive. Besides propagule pressure, however, no other generally strong determinant of invasion success is known. Although evidence has accumulated that human affiliates ( domesticates, pets, human commensals) also have high invasion success, existing studies do not distinguish whether this success can be completely explained by or is partly independent of propagule pressure. Here, we analyze both factors independently, propagule pressure and human affiliation. We also consider a third factor directly related to humans, hunting, and 17 traits on each species' population size and extent, diet, body size, and life history. Our dataset includes all 2362 freshwater fish, mammals, and birds native to Europe or North America. In contrast to most previous studies, we look at the complete invasion process consisting of (1) introduction, (2) establishment, and (3) spread. In this way, we not only consider which of the introduced species became invasive but also which species were introduced. Of the 20 factors tested, propagule pressure and human affiliation were the two strongest determinants of invasion success across all taxa and steps. This was true for multivariate analyses that account for intercorrelations among variables as well as univariate analyses, suggesting that human affiliation influenced invasion success independently of propagule pressure. Some factors affected the different steps of the invasion process antagonistically. For example, game species were much more likely to be introduced to an exotic continent than nonhunted species but tended to be less likely to establish themselves and spread. Such antagonistic effects show the importance of considering the complete invasion process.","Determinants of vertebrate invasion success in Europe and North America [SEP] Species that are frequently introduced to an exotic range have a high potential of becoming invasive.

Community Structure Affects Annual Grass Weed Invasion During Restoration of a Shrub-Steppe Ecosystem,"Ecological restoration of shrub-steppe communities in the western United States is often hampered by invasion of exotic annual grasses during the process. An important question is how to create restored communities that can better resist reinvasion by these weeds. One hypothesis is that communities comprised of species that are functionally similar to the invader will best resist invasion, while an alternative hypothesis is that structurally more complex and diverse communities will result in more effective competitive exclusion. In this field experiment, we examined the effects of restored community structure on the invasion success of three annual grass weeds (downy brome, jointed goatgrass, and cereal rye). We created replicated community plots that varied in species composition, structural complexity and density, then seeded in annual grass weeds and measured their biomass and seed production the following year, and their cover after 1 and 3 yr. Annual grass weeds were not strongly suppressed by any of the restored communities, indicating that it was difficult for native species to completely capture available resources and exclude annual grass weeds in the first years after planting. Perennial grass monocultures, particularly of the early seral grass bottlebrush squirreltail, were the most highly invaded communities, while structurally complex and diverse mixtures of shrubs (big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush), perennial grasses (bluebunch wheatgrass and bottlebrush squirreltail) and forbs (Lewis flax, Utah sweetvetch, hairy golden aster, gooseberryleaf globemallow) were more resistant to invasion. These results suggest that restoration of sagebrush steppe communities resistant to annual grass invasion benefits from higher species diversity; significant reduction of weed propagule pressure prior to restoration may be required.","Community Structure Affects Annual Grass Weed Invasion During Restoration of a Shrub-Steppe Ecosystem [SEP] Ecological restoration of shrub-steppe communities in the western United States is often hampered by invasion of exotic annual grasses during the process.

Darwin's naturalization hypothesis: scale matters in coastal plant communities,"Darwin proposed two seemingly contradictory hypotheses for a better understanding of biological invasions. Strong relatedness of invaders to native communities as an indication of niche overlap could promote naturalization because of appropriate niche adaptation, but could also hamper naturalization because of negative interactions with native species (Darwin's naturalization hypothesis'). Although these hypotheses provide clear and opposing predictions for expected patterns of species relatedness in invaded communities, so far no study has been able to clearly disentangle the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesize that conflicting past results are mainly due to the neglected role of spatial resolution of the community sampling. In this study, we corroborate both of Darwin's expectations by using phylogenetic relatedness as a measure of niche overlap and by testing the effects of sampling resolution in highly invaded coastal plant communities. At spatial resolutions fine enough to detect signatures of biotic interactions, we find that most invaders are less related to their nearest relative in invaded plant communities than expected by chance (phylogenetic overdispersion). Yet at coarser spatial resolutions, native assemblages become more invasible for closely-related species as a consequence of habitat filtering (phylogenetic clustering). Recognition of the importance of the spatial resolution at which communities are studied allows apparently contrasting theoretical and empirical results to be reconciled. Our study opens new perspectives on how to better detect, differentiate and understand the impact of negative biotic interactions and habitat filtering on the ability of invaders to establish in native communities.","Darwin's naturalization hypothesis: scale matters in coastal plant communities [SEP] Darwin proposed two seemingly contradictory hypotheses for a better understanding of biological invasions.

Introduction pathway and climate trump ecology and life history as predictors of establishment success in alien frogs and toads,"A major goal for ecology and evolution is to understand how abiotic and biotic factors shape patterns of biological diversity. Here, we show that variation in establishment success of nonnative frogs and toads is primarily explained by variation in introduction pathways and climatic similarity between the native range and introduction locality, with minor contributions from phylogeny, species ecology, and life history. This finding contrasts with recent evidence that particular species characteristics promote evolutionary range expansion and reduce the probability of extinction in native populations of amphibians, emphasizing how different mechanisms may shape species distributions on different temporal and spatial scales. We suggest that contemporary changes in the distribution of amphibians will be primarily determined by human-mediated extinctions and movement of species within climatic envelopes, and less by species-typical traits.","Introduction pathway and climate trump ecology and life history as predictors of establishment success in alien frogs and toads [SEP] A major goal for ecology and evolution is to understand how abiotic and biotic factors shape patterns of biological diversity.

Prescribed fire effects on dalmation toadflax,"Prescribed fires are important for rangeland restoration and affect plant community composition and species interactions. Many rangeland plant communities have been, or are under the threat of noxious weed invasion, however there is little information on how fire effects weeds. Our objective was to determine the effects of prescribed rangeland fire on dalmatian toadflax [Linaria dalmatica (L.) Miller] density, cover, biomass, and seed production. These plant characteristics, as well as density, cover, and biomass of perennial grasses and forbs were measured within burned and adjacent not-burned areas on 3 Artemisia tridentata/Agropyron spicatum habitat types in Montana. Areas were burned in the spring and measured in the fall 1999. Comparisons of plant characteristics between the burned and not-burned sites were made using t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. After 1 growing season, fire did not affect density or cover of dalmatian toadflax. Burning increased dalmatian toadflax biomass per square meter at 2 sites, and per plant biomass at all 3 sites. Seed production of dalmatian toadflax was increased by fire at all 3 sites. Fire reduced forb cover at 1 site and increased grass biomass at 2 sites. The increases in dalmatian toadflax biomass and seed production suggest that fire used to restore healthy plant communities may increase dalmatian toadflax dominance.

Exotic vascular plant invasiveness and forest invasibility in urban boreal forest types,"The riverine forests of the northern city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada display strong resilience to disturbance and are similar in species composition to southern boreal mixedwood forest types. This study addressed questions such as, how easily do exotic species become established in urban boreal forests (species invasiveness) and do urban boreal forest structural characteristics such as, native species richness, abundance, and vertical vegetation layers, confer resistance to exotic species establishment and spread (community invasibility)? Eighty-four forest stands were sampled and species composition and mean percent cover analyzed using ordination methods. Results showed that exotic tree/shrub types were of the most concern for invasion to urban boreal forests and that exotic species type, native habitat and propagule supply may be good indicators of invasive potential. Native forest structure appeared to confer a level of resistance to exotic species and medium to high disturbance intensity was associated with exotic species growth and spread without a corresponding loss in native species richness. Results provided large-scale evidence that diverse communities are less vulnerable to exotic species invasion, and that intermediate disturbance intensity supports species coexistence. From a management perspective, the retention of native species and native forest structure in urban forests is favored to minimize the impact of exotic species introductions, protect natural succession patterns, and minimize the spread of exotic species.","Exotic vascular plant invasiveness and forest invasibility in urban boreal forest types [SEP] The riverine forests of the northern city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada display strong resilience to disturbance and are similar in species composition to southern boreal mixedwood forest types.

Fire and competition in a southern California grassland: impacts on the rare forb Erodium macrophyllum,"1. The use of off-season burns to control exotic vegetation shows promise for land managers. In California, wildfires tend to occur in the summer and autumn, when most grassland vegetation is dormant. The effects of spring fires on native bunchgrasses have been examined but their impacts on native forbs have received less attention. 2. We introduced Erodium macrophyllum, a rare native annual forb, by seeding plots in 10 different areas in a California grassland. We tested the hypotheses that E. macrophyllum would perform better (increased fecundity and germination) when competing with native grasses than with a mixture of exotic and native grasses, and fire would alter subsequent demography of E. macrophyllum and other species' abundances. We monitored the demography of E. macrophyllum for two seasons in plots manually weeded so that they were free from exotics, and in areas that were burned or not burned the spring after seeding. 3. Weeding increased E. macrophyllum seedling emergence, survival and fecundity during both seasons. When vegetation was burned in June 2001 (at the end of the first growing season) to kill exotic grass seeds before they dispersed, all E. macrophyllum plants had finished their life cycle and dispersed seeds, suggesting that burns at this time of year would not directly impact on fecundity. In the growing season after burning (2002), burned plots had less recruitment of E. macrophyllum but more establishment of native grass seedlings, suggesting burning may differentially affect seedling recruitment. 4. At the end of the second growing season (June 2002), burned plots had less cover of exotic and native grasses but more cover of exotic forbs. Nevertheless, E. macrophyllum plants in burned plots had greater fecundity than in non-burned plots, suggesting that exotic grasses are more competitive than exotic forbs. 5. A glasshouse study showed that exotic grasses competitively suppress E. macrophyllum to a greater extent than native grasses, indicating that the poor performance of E. macrophyllum in the non-burned plots was due to exotic grass competition. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study illustrates that fire can alter the competitive environment in grasslands with differential effects on rare forbs, and that exotic grasses strongly interfere with E. macrophyllum. For land managers, the benefits of prescribed spring burns will probably outweigh the costs of decreased E. macrophyllum establishment. Land managers can use spring burns to cause a flush of native grass recruitment and to create an environment that is, although abundant with exotic forbs, ultimately less competitive compared with non-burned areas dominated by exotic grasses.","Fire and competition in a southern California grassland: impacts on the rare forb Erodium macrophyllum [SEP] 1. The use of off-season burns to control exotic vegetation shows promise for land managers. In California, wildfires tend to occur in the summer and autumn, when most grassland vegetation is dormant. The effects of spring fires on native bunchgrasses have been examined but their impacts on native forbs have received less attention. 2. We introduced Erodium macrophyllum, a rare native annual forb, by seeding plots in 10 different areas in a California grassland. We tested the hypotheses that E. macrophyllum would perform better (increased fecundity and germination) when competing with native grasses than with a mixture of exotic and native grasses, and fire would alter subsequent demography of E. macrophyllum and other species' abundances. We monitored the demography of E. macrophyllum for two seasons in plots manually weeded so that they were free from exotics, and in areas that were burned or not burned the spring after seeding. 3. Weeding increased E. macrophyllum seedling emergence, survival and fecundity during both seasons. When vegetation was burned in June 2001 (at the end of the first growing season) to kill exotic grass seeds before they dispersed, all E. macrophyllum plants had finished their life cycle and dispersed seeds, suggesting that burns at this time of year would not directly impact on fecundity. In the growing season after burning (2002), burned plots had less recruitment of E. macrophyllum but more establishment of native grass seedlings, suggesting burning may differentially affect seedling recruitment. 4. At the end of the second growing season (June 2002), burned plots had less cover of exotic and native grasses but more cover of exotic forbs.

Effects of an intense prescribed fire on understory vegetation in a mixed conifer forest,"Intense prescribed fire has been suggested as a possible method for forest restoration in mixed conifer forests. In 1993, a prescribed fire in a dense, never-harvested forest on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park escaped prescription and burned with greater intensity and severity than expected. We sampled this burned area and an adjacent unburned area to assess fire effects on understory species composition, diversity, and plant cover. The unburned area was sampled in 1998 and the burned area in 1999; 25% of the plots were resampled in 2001 to ensure that differences between sites were consistent and persistent, and not due to inter-annual climatic differences. Species composition differed significantly between unburned and burned sites; eight species were identified as indicators of the unburned site and thirteen as indicators of the burned site. Plant cover was nearly twice as great in the burned site than in the unburned site in the first years of measurement and was 4.6 times greater in the burned site in 2001. Average and total species richness was greater in the burned site, explained mostly by higher numbers of native annual and biennial forbs. Overstory canopy cover and duff depth were significantly lower in the burned site, and there were significant inverse relationships between these variables and plant species richness and plant cover. Greater than 95% of the species in the post-fire community were native and exotic plant cover never exceeded 1%, in contrast with other northern Arizona forests that were dominated by exotic species following high-severity fires. This difference is attributed to the minimal anthropogenic disturbance history (no logging, minimal grazing) of forests in the national park, and suggests that park managers may have more options than non-park managers to use intense fire as a tool for forest conservation and restoration.","Effects of an intense prescribed fire on understory vegetation in a mixed conifer forest [SEP] Intense prescribed fire has been suggested as a possible method for forest restoration in mixed conifer forests.

"Predicting Richness of Native, Rare, and Exotic Plants in Response to Habitat and Disturbance Variables across a Variegated Landscape","Species richness o native, rare native, and exotic understorey plants was recorded at 120 sites in temperate grassy vegetation in New South Wales. Linear models were used to predict the effects of environment and disturbance on the richness of each of these groups. Total native species and rare native species showed similar responses, with richness declining on sites of increasing natural fertility of parent material as well as declining under conditions of water enrichment (resulting from human-induced changes in drainage characteristics, leading to increased run-off), severe livestock grazing, and soil disturbance. The response of rare native species to water enrichment however, was significantly greater than that of all native species. Exotic species richness varied in reverse to that of native species with positive responses to water enrichment and soil disturbance, The contrasting behaviors are attributed to differences in the evolutionary history of native and exotic assemblages and their resulting preadaptations to a landscape recently subjected to agricultural settlement It would appear that for exogenous disturbances, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is not supported by our data In the sampled region, pastures represent the major land-use in terms of area, but have relatively low densities of native and rare species compared with more lightly grazed areas. However, their management is considered to be essential to the maintenance of diversity on a regional scale.","Predicting Richness of Native, Rare, and Exotic Plants in Response to Habitat and Disturbance Variables across a Variegated Landscape [SEP] Species richness o native, rare native, and exotic understorey plants was recorded at 120 sites in temperate grassy vegetation in New South Wales.

Disturbance-mediated competition and the spread of Phragmites australis in a coastal marsh,"In recent decades the grass Phragmites australis has been aggressively invading coastal, tidal marshes of North America, and in many areas it is now considered a nuisance species. While P. australis has historically been restricted to the relatively benign upper border of brackish and salt marshes, it has been expanding seaward into more physiologically stressful regions. Here we test a leading hypothesis that the spread of P. australis is due to anthropogenic modification of coastal marshes. We did a field experiment along natural borders between stands of P. australis and the other dominant grasses and rushes (i.e., matrix vegetation) in a brackish marsh in Rhode Island, USA. We applied a pulse disturbance in one year by removing or not removing neighboring matrix vegetation and adding three levels of nutrients (specifically nitrogen) in a factorial design, and then we monitored the aboveground performance of P. australis and the matrix vegetation. Both disturbances increased the density, height, and biomass of shoots of P. australis, and the effects of fertilization were more pronounced where matrix vegetation was removed. Clearing competing matrix vegetation also increased the distance that shoots expanded and their reproductive output, both indicators of the potential for P. australis to spread within and among local marshes. In contrast, the biomass of the. matrix vegetation decreased with increasing severity of disturbance. Disturbance increased the total aboveground production of plants in the marsh as matrix vegetation was displaced by P. australis. A greenhouse experiment showed that, with increasing nutrient levels, P. australis allocates proportionally more of its biomass to aboveground structures used for spread than to belowground structures used for nutrient acquisition. Therefore, disturbances that enrich nutrients or remove competitors promote the spread of P. australis by reducing belowground competition for nutrients between P. australis and the matrix vegetation, thus allowing P. australis, the largest plant in the marsh, to expand and displace the matrix vegetation. Reducing nutrient load and maintaining buffers of matrix vegetation along the terrestrial-marsh ecotone will, therefore, be important methods of control for this nuisance species.","Disturbance-mediated competition and the spread of Phragmites australis in a coastal marsh [SEP] In recent decades the grass Phragmites australis has been aggressively invading coastal, tidal marshes of North America, and in many areas it is now considered a nuisance species.

The paradox of invasion in birds: competitive superiority or ecological opportunism?,"Why can alien species succeed in environments to which they have had no opportunity to adapt and even become more abundant than many native species? Ecological theory suggests two main possible answers for this paradox: competitive superiority of exotic species over native species and opportunistic use of ecological opportunities derived from human activities. We tested these hypotheses in birds combining field observations and experiments along gradients of urbanization in New South Wales (Australia). Five exotic species attained densities in the study area comparable to those of the most abundant native species, and hence provided a case for the invasion paradox. The success of these alien birds was not primarily associated with a competitive superiority over native species: the most successful invaders were smaller and less aggressive than their main native competitors, and were generally excluded from artificially created food patches where competition was high. More importantly, exotic birds were primarily restricted to urban environments, where the diversity and abundance of native species were low. This finding agrees with previous studies and indicates that exotic and native species rarely interact in nature. Observations and experiments in the field revealed that the few native species that exploit the most urbanized environments tended to be opportunistic foragers, adaptations that should facilitate survival in places where disturbances by humans are frequent and natural vegetation has been replaced by man-made structures. Successful invaders also shared these features, suggesting that their success is not a paradox but can be explained by their capacity to exploit ecological opportunities that most native species rarely use.","The paradox of invasion in birds: competitive superiority or ecological opportunism?

Importance of molehill disturbances for invasion by Bunias orientails in meadows and pastures,"Small-scale soil disturbances by fossorial animals can change physical and biotic conditions in disturbed patches and influence spatial and temporal dynamics, and the composition of plant communities. They create regeneration niches and colonization openings for native plants and, according to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, they are expected to increase plant community diversity. However, it also has been reported that increased disturbance resource availability and decreased competition with native species may result in the invasion of communities by alien plant species, as predicted by the fluctuating resources theory of invasibility. In this study, we investigated the importance of European mole disturbances for the invasion of semi-natural fresh meadows and pastures by the alien plant, Bunks orientalis, which has mainly spread throughout Central Europe on anthropogenically disturbed sites. We hypothesized that the invader, being particularly well adapted to anthropogenic disturbances, enters into dense vegetation of meadows and pastures mainly on mole mounds. To assess the seedling recruitment of Bunks orientalis in relation to disturbance, we counted the number of seedlings that emerged on molehills and control plots in meadows and pastures. The establishment of juvenile (0-1 year) rosette plants on and off molehills was surveyed on 5 x 5 m plots. In accordance with our hypothesis, mole disturbances were found to serve as a gateway for Bunks orientalis by which the invader may colonize semi-natural grasslands. The seedlings of the species emerged almost solely on molehills and the young rosettes were established predominantly on mole mounds. Although the seedling density did not differ significantly between the meadows and pastures, the number of established plants in the pastures was considerably higher. We suggest that the invasion by Bunks orientalis in pastures may be facilitated by vegetative regeneration following root fragmentation by sheep pasturing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Relative importance of wetland type versus anthropogenic activities in determining site invasibility,"We assessed wetland invasibility by conducting surveys of three wetlands in each of five categories (riverine, depression, lacustrine fringe, mineral flat, and seepage slope). Invasibility was measured as the number of invasive species present, percent of plant species classified as invasive, percent cover of invasive plants, and percent of total cover represented by invasive species. The working hypothesis for this study was that certain types of wetlands (e.g., lacustrine fringe and riverine) would be more prone to invasion than others (spring-seep/slope wetlands or mineral flat wetlands). No significant differences were found among wetland types in any of the invasion metrics evaluated, despite high average invasibility in the riverine and lacustrine fringe categories. However, invasion was correlated very strongly with a qualitative index of anthropogenic modification to the surrounding landscape. A probable result of the substantial influence of human activities on wetland invasion in this study was that effects potentially attributable to greater opportunity for dispersal in certain types of wetlands were obscured. Another factor that likely contributed to the lack of differences among wetland types was the high variability in human activities observed among wetlands within types. These results further highlight the overwhelming contributions of anthropogenic habitat modification and human-assisted dispersal of invasive species to the currently observed homogenization of natural ecosystems.","Relative importance of wetland type versus anthropogenic activities in determining site invasibility [SEP] We assessed wetland invasibility by conducting surveys of three wetlands in each of five categories (riverine, depression, lacustrine fringe, mineral flat, and seepage slope).

Plant invasions along mountain roads: the altitudinal amplitude of alien Asteraceae forbs in their native and introduced ranges,"Studying plant invasions along environmental gradients is a promising approach to dissect the relative importance of multiple interacting factors that affect the spread of a species in a new range. Along altitudinal gradients, factors such as propagule pressure, climatic conditions and biotic interactions change simultaneously across rather small geographic scales. Here we investigate the distribution of eight Asteraceae forbs along mountain roads in both their native and introduced ranges in the Valais (southern Swiss Alps) and the Wallowa Mountains (northeastern Oregon, USA). We hypothesised that a lack of adaptation and more limiting propagule pressure at higher altitudes in the new range restricts the altitudinal distribution of aliens relative to the native range. However, all but one of the species reached the same or even a higher altitude in the new range. Thus neither the need to adapt to changing climatic conditions nor lower propagule pressure at higher altitudes appears to have prevented the altitudinal spread of introduced populations. We found clear differences between regions in the relative occurrence of alien species in ruderal sites compared to roadsides, and in the degree of invasion away from the roadside, presumably reflecting differences in disturbance patterns between regions. Whilst the upper altitudinal limits of these plant invasions are apparently climatically constrained, factors such as anthropogenic disturbance and competition with native vegetation appear to have greater influence than changing climatic conditions on the distribution of these alien species along altitudinal gradients.","Plant invasions along mountain roads: the altitudinal amplitude of alien Asteraceae forbs in their native and introduced ranges [SEP] Studying plant invasions along environmental gradients is a promising approach to dissect the relative importance of multiple interacting factors that affect the spread of a species in a new range.

Road verges as invasion corridors? A spatial hierarchical test in an arid ecosystem,"Disturbed habitats are often swiftly colonized by alien plant species. Human inhabited areas may act as sources from which such aliens disperse, while road verges have been suggested as corridors facilitating their dispersal. We therefore hypothesized that (i) houses and urban areas are propagule sources from which aliens disperse, and that (ii) road verges act as corridors for their dispersal. We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 25m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n=240). Plots consisted of three adjacent nested transects. Houses (n=3,349) were mapped within a 5-km radius from plots using topographical maps. Environmental processes as predictors of alien composition differed across spatial levels. At the broadest scale road-surface type, soil type, and competition from indigenous plants were the strongest predictors of alien composition. Within localities disturbance-related variables such as distance from dwellings and urban areas were associated with alien composition, but their effect differed between localities. Within roads, density and proximity of houses was related to higher alien species richness. Plot distance from urban areas, however, was not a significant predictor of alien richness or cover at any of the spatial levels, refuting the corridor hypothesis. Verges hosted but did not facilitate the spread of alien species. The scale dependence and multiplicity of mechanisms explaining alien plant communities found here highlight the importance of considering regional climatic gradients, landscape context and road-verge properties themselves when managing verges.","Road verges as invasion corridors?

"Exploring the potential for climatic factors, herbivory, and co-occurring vegetation to shape performance in native and introduced populations of Verbascum thapsus","Biogeographic data describing performance differences in native and introduced populations of invasive species are increasingly coming to light, revealing that introduced populations often perform better than their native conspecifics. However, this pattern is not universal, nor is it well studied in species that fall on the more ""benign"" end of the invasion spectrum. Furthermore, performance data are infrequently linked with variation in key environmental factors experienced by populations in each range, making it difficult to assess which factors are typically associated with shifts in performance. Here we assessed performance in native and introduced populations of Verbascum thapsus (common mullein), an herbaceous biennial that was initially introduced to the eastern US from Europe, but which has subsequently expanded its range into semi-arid mountainous regions of the western US, where it appears to be more problematic. Indeed, we found that introduced populations were larger than native populations, with over half of them comprising more than 500 individuals, a size seldom achieved in the native range. We further explored the role that abiotic factors (latitude, elevation, and precipitation) might serve in shaping performance in European and western US populations, and quantified variation in two biotic factors relevant to invasion: herbivory, and the potential for competition from co-occurring vegetation (as well as its inverse, the availability of bare ground). When the influence of abiotic factors was not considered, introduced mullein performed better than native mullein in terms of plant density and plant size (i.e., number of leaves and area covered by the basal rosette). When the influence of abiotic factors was statistically taken into account, the difference in the density of native and introduced populations remained strong, while the difference in number of leaves was reduced, though it remained significant. In contrast, controlling for abiotic factors reversed the pattern for plant area such that plants in introduced populations performed less well than natives. These results suggest that the difference in climate experienced by native and introduced populations is an important driver of mullein performance only for plant area. Thus, increased performance in western US population likely hinges in part on shifts in biotic factors. Indeed, we found a reduction in the prevalence of several herbivore guilds on introduced relative to native mullein, accompanied by a significant decrease in chewing damage in introduced populations. We also found differences in the potential for competition: cover of vegetation is significantly higher in native mullein populations than in introduced populations, and increasing cover of vegetation is associated with declining performance (i.e., density) of native populations but not introduced populations. In sum, the introduced populations performed better than the native populations in several respects; thus, although mullein is considered a relatively 'benign' introduced species, it has the potential to differentially impact resident communities in its native and introduced ranges. Additionally, despite the disparity in abiotic conditions experienced by native and introduced populations, these factors do not appear to consistently drive differences in performance. Instead, evidence suggests that enemy escape and shifts in the competitive regime may facilitate mullein invasion. We use our data to propose hypotheses to be tested experimentally.","Exploring the potential for climatic factors, herbivory, and co-occurring vegetation to shape performance in native and introduced populations of Verbascum thapsus [SEP] Biogeographic data describing performance differences in native and introduced populations of invasive species are increasingly coming to light, revealing that introduced populations often perform better than their native conspecifics.

However, in general, evidence suggests that a high proportion of their native parasites are lost during introduction and infections by some new parasites from the native range might occur, potentially resulting in parasite spill-back to native species. These processes were investigated here using parasite surveys and literature review on seven non-native freshwater fishes introduced into England and Wales. Comparison of the mean numbers of parasite species and genera per population for each fish species England and Wales with their native ranges revealed <9 % of the native parasite fauna were present in their populations in England and Wales. There was no evidence suggesting these introduced parasites had spilled over into sympatric native fishes. The non-native fishes did acquire parasites following their introduction, providing potential for parasite spill-back to sympatric fishes, and resulted in non-significant differences in overall mean numbers of parasites per populations between the two ranges. Through this acquisition, the non-native fishes also had mean numbers of parasite species and genera per population that were not significantly different to sympatric native fishes. Thus, the non-native fishes in England and Wales showed evidence of enemy release, acquired new parasites following introduction providing potential for spill-back, but showed no evidence of parasite spill-over.","Parasites of non-native freshwater fishes introduced into England and Wales suggest enemy release and parasite acquisition [SEP] When non-native species are introduced into a new range, their parasites can also be introduced, with these potentially spilling-over into native hosts.

Release from native herbivores facilitates the persistence of invasive marine algae: a biogeographical comparison of the relative contribution of nutrients and herbivory to invasion success,"The effect of herbivory and nutrient enrichment on the growth of invasive and native macroalgal species was simultaneously studied in two biogeographic regions: the Caribbean and Hawaii. Herbivores suppressed growth of invasive algae in their native (Caribbean) and invaded range (Hawaii), but despite similar levels of herbivore biomass, the intensity of herbivory was lower in Hawaii. Algal species with a circumtropical distribution did not show a similar effect of herbivores on their growth. Nutrient enrichment did not enhance growth of any algal species in either region. The reduction in herbivore intensity experienced by invasive algae in Hawaii rather than an escape from (native) herbivores provided invasive macroalgae with ""enemy release"" sensu the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH). Since native, Hawaiian herbivores still feed and even prefer invasive algae over native species, invasion scenario's that involve predation (e.g. the ERH) could be falsely dismissed when invasive species are only studied in their invasive range. We therefore argue that escape from herbivores (i.e. enemy release) can only effectively be determined with additional information on the intensity of predation experienced by an invasive species in its native range.","Release from native herbivores facilitates the persistence of invasive marine algae: a biogeographical comparison of the relative contribution of nutrients and herbivory to invasion success [SEP] The effect of herbivory and nutrient enrichment on the growth of invasive and native macroalgal species was simultaneously studied in two biogeographic regions: the Caribbean and Hawaii.

Parasites and invasions: a biogeographic examination of parasites and hosts in native and introduced ranges,"Aim To use a comparative approach to understand parasite demographic patterns in native versus introduced populations, evaluating the potential roles of host invasion history and parasite life history. Location North American east and west coasts with a focus on San Francisco Bay (SFB). Methods Species richness and prevalence of trematode parasites were examined in the native and introduced ranges of two gastropod host species, Ilyanassa obsoleta and Littorina saxatilis. We divided the native range into the putative source area for introduction and areas to the north and south; we also sampled the overlapping introduced range in SFB. We dissected 14,781 snails from 103 populations and recorded the prevalence and identity of trematode parasites. We compared trematode species richness and prevalence across the hosts' introduced and native ranges, and evaluated the influence of host availability on observed patterns. Results Relative to the native range, both I. obsoleta and L. saxatilis have escaped (lost) parasites in SFB, and L. saxatilis demonstrated a greater reduction of trematode diversity and infection prevalence than I. obsoleta. This was not due to sampling inequalities between the hosts. Instead, rarefaction curves suggested complete capture of trematode species in native source and SFB subregions, except for L. saxatilis in SFB, where infection was extremely rare. For I. obsoleta, infection prevalence of trematodes using fish definitive hosts was significantly lower in SFB compared to the native range, unlike those using bird hosts. Host availability partly explained the presence of introduced trematodes in SFB. Main conclusions Differential losses of parasite richness and prevalence for the two gastropod host species in their introduced range is probably the result of several mechanistic factors: time since introduction, propagule pressure, vector of introduction, and host availability. Moreover, the recent occurrence of L. saxatilis' invasion and its active introduction vector suggest that its parasite diversity and distribution will probably increase over time. Our study suggests that host invasion history and parasite life history play key roles in the extent and diversity of trematodes transferred to introduced populations. Our results also provide vital information for understanding community-level influences of parasite introductions, as well as for disease ecology in general.","Parasites and invasions: a biogeographic examination of parasites and hosts in native and introduced ranges [SEP] Aim To use a comparative approach to understand parasite demographic patterns in native versus introduced populations, evaluating the potential roles of host invasion history and parasite life history.

Time lags in biological invasions with regard to the success and failure of alien species.,"The historical reconstruction of invasion dynamics of woody species alien to Brandenburg, Germany revealed that 210 species began to spread within the period 1780 to 1990. Lag phases between the first release for cultivation and the beginning of spontaneous spread were reconstructed for 184 species. On average, there was a time lag of 147 years between the introduction to Brandenburg and the initiation of invasion (170 years for trees, 131 for shrubs). The first occurrence of a seedling in the area was defined as the start of a biological invasion without regard to the subsequent success or failure of this invasion. Species' success and failure were evaluated in terms of naturalization and frequency of the 3150 woody species introduced to Germany. It was established that successful invaders are not necessarily quicker in starting invasions and that less than 10% of the introduced species begin to invade, 2% become established, and 1% may successfully invade natural vegetation. When applying this 10:2=1 rule to assess the invasion risk, is has to be considered that the ration between introductions and starting invasions is not constant, but has increased through time: in 1780 only about 3% of the introduced species had invaded, compared to 7.4% in 1990. Consequently, the number of invasions breaking out will still increase, even if no additional species are introduced. The analysis of timing of biological invasions cannot be explained sufficiently by deterministic factors referring to species' life history. As discussed for some species, the successful invasion can be due to an interaction of directional climatic changes (rising temperatures since 1850) and of stochastically induced shifts in the availability and accessibility of safe sites.","Time lags in biological invasions with regard to the success and failure of alien species.

Comparison of parasite diversity in native panopeid mud crabs and the invasive Asian shore crab in estuaries of northeast North America,"Numerous non-indigenous species (NIS) have successfully established in new locales, where they can have large impacts on community and ecosystem structure. A loss of natural enemies, such as parasites, is one mechanism proposed to contribute to that success. While several studies have shown NIS are initially less parasitized than native conspecifics, fewer studies have investigated whether parasite richness changes over time. Moreover, evaluating the role that parasites have in invaded communities requires not only an understanding of the parasite diversity of NIS but also the species with which they interact; yet parasite diversity in native species may be inadequately quantified. In our study, we examined parasite taxonomic richness, infection prevalence, and infection intensity in the invasive Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus De Haan, 1835 and two native mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii Milne-Edwards, 1834 and Eurypanopeus depressus Smith, 1869) in estuarine and coastal communities along the east coast of the USA. We also examined reproductive tissue allocation (i.e., the proportion of gonad weight to total body weight) in all three crabs to explore possible differences in infected versus uninfected crabs. We found three parasite taxa infecting H. sanguineus and four taxa infecting mud crabs, including a rhizocephalan castrator (Loxothylacus panopaei) parasitizing E. depressus. Moreover, we documented a significant negative relationship between parasite escape and time for H. sanguineus, including a new 2015 record of a native microphallid trematode. Altogether, there was no significant difference in taxonomic richness among the crab species. Across parasite taxa, H. sanguineus demonstrated significantly lower infection prevalence compared to P. herbstii; yet a multivariate analysis of taxa-specific prevalence demonstrated no significant differences among crabs. Finally, infected P. herbstii had the highest proportion of gonad weight to total body weight. Our study finds some evidence for lower infection prevalence in the non-native versus the native hosts. However, we also demonstrate that parasite escape can lessen with time. Our work has implications for the understanding of the potential influence parasites may have on the future success of NIS in introduced regions.","Comparison of parasite diversity in native panopeid mud crabs and the invasive Asian shore crab in estuaries of northeast North America [SEP] Numerous non-indigenous species (NIS) have successfully established in new locales, where they can have large impacts on community and ecosystem structure.

Coexistence between native and exotic species is facilitated by asymmetries in competitive ability and susceptibility to herbivores,"Differences between native and exotic species in competitive ability and susceptibility to herbivores are hypothesized to facilitate coexistence. However, little fieldwork has been conducted to determine whether these differences are present in invaded communities. Here, we experimentally examined whether asymmetries exist between native and exotic plants in a community invaded for over 200 years and whether removing competitors or herbivores influences coexistence. We found that natives and exotics exhibit pronounced asymmetries, as exotics are competitively superior to natives, but are more significantly impacted by herbivores. We also found that herbivore removal mediated the outcome of competitive interactions and altered patterns of dominance across our field sites. Collectively, these findings suggest that asymmetric biotic interactions between native and exotic plants can help to facilitate coexistence in invaded communities.","Coexistence between native and exotic species is facilitated by asymmetries in competitive ability and susceptibility to herbivores [SEP] Differences between native and exotic species in competitive ability and susceptibility to herbivores are hypothesized to facilitate coexistence.

Enemy release and genetic founder effects in invasive killer shrimp populations of Great Britain,"The predatory ""killer shrimp"" Dikerogammarus villosus invaded Britain from mainland Europe in 2010. Originating in the Ponto-Caspian region, this invader has caused significant degradation of European freshwater ecosystems by predating and competitively excluding native invertebrate species. In contrast to continental Europe, in which invasions occurred through the migration of large numbers of individuals along rivers and canals, the invasion of Great Britain must have involved long distance dispersal across the sea. This makes the loss of genetic diversity and of debilitating parasites more likely. Analysis of nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences of D. villosus samples from the four known populations in Britain reveal loss of rare alleles, in comparison to reference populations from the west coast of continental Europe. Screening of the British D. villosus populations by PCR detected no microsporidian parasites, in contrast with continental populations of D. villosus and native amphipod populations, most of which are infected with microsporidia. These findings suggest that the initial colonisation of Great Britain and subsequent long distance dispersal within Britain were associated with genetic founder effects and enemy release due to loss of parasites. Such effects are also likely to occur during future long-distance dispersal events of D. villosus to Ireland or North America.","Enemy release and genetic founder effects in invasive killer shrimp populations of Great Britain [SEP] The predatory ""killer shrimp"" Dikerogammarus villosus invaded Britain from mainland Europe in 2010.

"Biotic resistance via granivory: establishment by invasive, naturalized, and native asters reflects generalist preference","Escape from specialist natural enemies is frequently invoked to explain exotic plant invasions, but little attention has been paid to how generalist consumers in the recipient range may influence invasion. We examined how seed preferences of the widespread generalist granivore Peromyscus maniculatus related to recruitment of the strongly invasive exotic Centaurea stoebe and several weakly invasive exotics and natives by conducting laboratory feeding trials and seed addition experiments in the field. Laboratory feeding trials showed that P. maniculatus avoided consuming seeds of C. stoebe relative to the 12 other species tested, even when seeds of alternative species were 53-94% smaller than those of C. stoebe. Seed addition experiments conducted in and out of rodent exclosures revealed that weakly invasive exotics experienced relatively greater release from seed predation than C. stoebe, although this was not the case for natives. Seed mass explained 81% of the variation in recruitment associated with rodent exclusion for natives and weak invaders, with larger-seeded species benefiting most from protection from granivores. However, recruitment of C. stoebe was unaffected by rodent exclusion, even though the regression model predicted seeds of correspondingly large mass should experience substantial predation. These combined laboratory and field results suggest that generalist granivores can be an important biological filter in plant communities and that species-specific seed attributes that determine seed predation may help to explain variation in native plant recruitment and the success of exotic species invasions.","Biotic resistance via granivory: establishment by invasive, naturalized, and native asters reflects generalist preference [SEP] Escape from specialist natural enemies is frequently invoked to explain exotic plant invasions, but little attention has been paid to how generalist consumers in the recipient range may influence invasion.

Parasites and genetic diversity in an invasive bumblebee,"Biological invasions are facilitated by the global transportation of species and climate change. Given that invasions may cause ecological and economic damage and pose a major threat to biodiversity, understanding the mechanisms behind invasion success is essential. Both the release of non-native populations from natural enemies, such as parasites, and the genetic diversity of these populations may play key roles in their invasion success. We investigated the roles of parasite communities, through enemy release and parasite acquisition, and genetic diversity in the invasion success of the non-native bumblebee, Bombus hypnorum, in the United Kingdom. The invasive B.hypnorum had higher parasite prevalence than most, or all native congeners for two high-impact parasites, probably due to higher susceptibility and parasite acquisition. Consequently parasites had a higher impact on B.hypnorum queens' survival and colony-founding success than on native species. Bombus hypnorum also had lower functional genetic diversity at the sex-determining locus than native species. Higher parasite prevalence and lower genetic diversity have not prevented the rapid invasion of the United Kingdom by B.hypnorum. These data may inform our understanding of similar invasions by commercial bumblebees around the world. This study suggests that concerns about parasite impacts on the small founding populations common to re-introduction and translocation programs may be less important than currently believed.","Parasites and genetic diversity in an invasive bumblebee [SEP] Biological invasions are facilitated by the global transportation of species and climate change.

Biotic resistance to plant invasion in grassland: Does seed predation increase with resident plant diversity?,"Seed predation impacts heavily on plant populations and community composition in grasslands. In particular, generalist seed predators may contribute to biotic resistance, i.e. the ability of resident species in a community to reduce the success of non-indigenous plant invaders. However, little is known of predators' preferences for seeds of indigenous or non-indigenous plant species or how seed predation varies across communities. We hypothesize that seed predation does not differ between indigenous and non-indigenous plant species and that seed predation is positively related to plant species diversity in the resident community. The seed removal of 36 indigenous and non-indigenous grassland species in seven extensively or intensively managed hay meadows across Switzerland covering a species-richness gradient of 18-50 plant species per unit area (c. 2 m2) was studied. In mid-summer 2011, c. 24,000 seeds were exposed to predators in Petri dishes filled with sterilized soil, and the proportions of seeds removed were determined after three days' exposure. These proportions varied among species (9.2-62.5%) and hay meadows (17.8-48.6%). Seed removal was not related to seed size. Moreover, it did not differ between indigenous and non-indigenous species, suggesting that mainly generalist seed predators were active. However, seed predation was positively related to plant species richness across a gradient in the range of 18-38 species per unit area, representing common hay meadows in Switzerland. Our results suggest that generalist post-dispersal seed predation contributes to biotic resistance and may act as a filter to plant invasion by reducing the propagule pressure of non-local plant species.","Biotic resistance to plant invasion in grassland: Does seed predation increase with resident plant diversity?

Our results suggest that generalist post-dispersal seed predation contributes to biotic resistance and may act as a filter to plant invasion by reducing the propagule pressure of non-local plant species.","0-1,1-0",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pollinators and predators at home and away: do they determine invasion success for Australian Acacia in New Zealand?,"AimInteractions with pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators are important determinants of reproductive output and could influence the success of plant species introduced to areas outside their native range. We identified the role of these interactions in determining reproductive output and invasion outcomes for species of Australian Acacia introduced to New Zealand.LocationAustralia and New Zealand.Methods We studied three species of Australian Acacia with different invasion success in New Zealand. In both Australia and New Zealand, we measured pollination success as the number of pods per inflorescence and the proportion of aborted seeds per pod, determined losses to pre-dispersal seed predators, and measured overall seed output. For each species, we compared performance in New Zealand with that in Australia, then examined whether there was any variation among species in their relative performance in each country.ResultsThe number of pods per inflorescence and proportion of seeds aborted were similar in each country and among species. There was little difference in pre-dispersal seed predation rate between Australia and New Zealand for Acacia dealbata, an invasive species, and Acacia baileyana, a species widely naturalized in New Zealand. However, pre-dispersal seed predation rate was lower in New Zealand for Acacia pravissima, currently considered to be a casual species there. Both the invasive A. dealbata and the casual A. pravissima produced more seeds per tree in New Zealand than Australia.Main conclusionsDifferences in reproductive success between the native and introduced range could not explain the differences in invasion success among the three Acacia species. Although per capita reproductive output was higher in New Zealand for two species, neither mutualistic interactions with pollinators nor antagonistic interactions with pre-dispersal seed predators explained those differences. The high seed output of A. pravissima suggests it has the potential to become invasive. These findings highlight the value of broad comparative studies in elucidating the drivers of invasion.","Pollinators and predators at home and away: do they determine invasion success for Australian Acacia in New Zealand?

Invasiveness of Ammophila arenaria: Release from soil-borne pathogens?,"The Natural Enemies Hypothesis (i.e., introduced species experience release from their natural enemies) is a common explanation for why invasive species are so successful. We tested this hypothesis for Ammophila arenaria (Poaceae: European beachgrass), an aggressive plant invading the coastal dunes of California, USA, by comparing the demographic effects of belowground pathogens on A. arenaria in its introduced range to those reported in its native range. European research on A. arenaria in its native range has established that soil-borne pathogens, primarily nematodes and fungi, reduce A. arenaria's growth. In a greenhouse experiment designed to parallel European studies, seeds and 2-wk-old seedlings were planted in sterilized and nonsterilized soil collected from the A. arenaria root zone in its introduced range of California. We assessed the effects of pathogens via soil sterilization on three early performance traits: seed germination, seedling survival, and plant growth. We found that seed germination was reduced by 12-16% in nonsterilized soil compared with sterilized soil; similarly, seedling survival was reduced by 7-13%. Both root and shoot biomass decreased in the nonsterilized soil treatments compared with sterilized soil, by as much as 81% after 6 wk of growth. A comparison of the introduced and native ranges failed to show a demographic release from natural enemies; biomass effects of pathogens after 6 and 12 wk of growth were nearly equal between studies in California and The Netherlands. Identification of pathogens and inoculation experiments with fungi from the nonsterilized soil revealed several common fungal pathogens, whereas virtually no pathogenic nematodes were found. Therefore, we found a partial escape from enemies (i.e., pathogenic nematodes were absent in the introduced range), although there was no demographic release. These findings suggest that to fully understand the success and impact of A. arenaria in North America, one must look beyond escape from natural enemies.","Invasiveness of Ammophila arenaria: Release from soil-borne pathogens?

Ecological traits of the amphipod invader Dikerogammarus villosus on a mesohabitat scale,"Since 1995, Dikerogammarus Villosus SONVINSKI, a Ponto-Caspian amphipod species, has been invading most of Western Europe's hydrosystems. D. villosus geographic extension and quickly increasing population density has enabled it to become a major component of macrobenthic assemblages in recipient ecosystems. The ecological characteristics of D. villosus on a mesohabitat scale were investigated at a station in the Moselle River. This amphipod is able to colonize a wide range of substratum types, thus posing a threat to all freshwater ecosystems. Rivers whose dominant substratum is cobbles and which have tree roots along the banks could harbour particularly high densities of D. villosus. A relationship exists between substratum particle size and the length of the individuals, and spatial segregation according to length was shown. This allows the species to limit intra-specific competition between generations while facilitating reproduction. A strong association exists between D. villosus and other Ponto-Caspian species, such as Dreissena polymorpha and Corophium curvispinum, in keeping with Invasional Meltdown Theory. Four taxa (Coenagrionidae, Calopteryx splendens, Corophium curvispinum and Gammarus pulex) exhibited spatial niches that overlap significantly that of D. villosus. According to the predatory behaviour of the newcomer, their populations may be severely impacted.","Ecological traits of the amphipod invader Dikerogammarus villosus on a mesohabitat scale [SEP] Since 1995, Dikerogammarus Villosus SONVINSKI, a Ponto-Caspian amphipod species, has been invading most of Western Europe's hydrosystems.

Invasional 'meltdown' on an oceanic island,"Islands can serve as model systems for understanding how biological invasions affect community structure and ecosystem function. Here we show invasion by the alien crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes causes a rapid, catastrophic shift in the rain forest ecosystem of a tropical oceanic island, affecting at least three trophic levels. In invaded areas, crazy ants extirpate the red land crab, the dominant endemic consumer on the forest floor. In doing so, crazy ants indirectly release seedling recruitment, enhance species richness of seedlings, and slow litter breakdown. In the forest canopy, new associations between this invasive ant and honeydew-secreting scale insects accelerate and diversify impacts. Sustained high densities of foraging ants on canopy trees result in high population densities of host-generalist scale insects and growth of sooty moulds, leading to canopy dieback and even deaths of canopy trees. The indirect fallout from the displacement of a native 'keystone' species by an ant invader, itself abetted by introduced/cryptogenic mutualists, produces synergism in impacts to precipitate invasional 'meltdown' in this system.","Invasional 'meltdown' on an oceanic island [SEP] Islands can serve as model systems for understanding how biological invasions affect community structure and ecosystem function.

Niche differentiation among invasive crayfish and their impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning,"Many aquatic ecosystems sustain multiple invasive species and interactions among them have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning. Here, we examine interactions among two pairs of invasive crayfish species because of their close proximity and thus chance of sympatric populations in the near future within the Thames catchment, U.K. (signal, Pacifastacus leniusculus and virile crayfish, Orconectes virilis within a river system; red swamp, Procambarus clarkii and Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus found within a suite of ponds). We address two questions: do sympatric invasive crayfish occupy a smaller niche than their allopatric counterparts due to potential resource competition? and do interactions among invasive species amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on the ecosystem? Two fully factorial mesocosm experiments (one for each crayfish pair) were used to investigate crayfish diet and their impact on benthic invertebrate community structure, benthic algal standing stock and leaf litter decomposition rates in allopatric and sympatric populations, compared with a crayfish-free control. We used stable isotope analysis to examine crayfish diet in the mesocosms and in allopatric populations of each species in the Thames catchment. Isotopic niche width did not vary significantly between allopatric and sympatric populations of crayfish in the mesocosm experiments, and isotopic niche partitioning in all the wild populations suggests the invaders can coexist. All four species altered benthic invertebrate community structure but with differing functional effects, often mediated via trophic cascades. Red swamp crayfish predation upon snails evidently promoted benthic algal standing stock via reduction in grazing pressure. However, a trophic cascade whereby the crayfish consumed native invertebrate shredders, causing a reduction in net leaf litter decomposition, was decoupled by red swamp and signal crayfish since they consumed leaf litter directly and thus moderated the cascade to a trickle when in sympatry with Turkish or virile crayfish, respectively. Benthic invertebrate predator abundance was significantly reduced by sympatric red swamp and Turkish crayfish but not independently when in allopatry, indicating an amplified effect overall when in sympatry. Our results suggest that the combined effect of multiple invasions on the ecosystem can reflect either an additive effect of their independent impacts or an amplified effect, which is greater than the sum of their independent impacts. A lack of general pattern in their effects makes any potential management strategy more complex.","Niche differentiation among invasive crayfish and their impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning [SEP] Many aquatic ecosystems sustain multiple invasive species and interactions among them have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning.

O. mykiss was first introduced in 1920 in the Chitose River system and has since successfully established a population. Subsequently, another nonnative salmonid species, S. trutta have expanded the Chitose River system since the early 1980s. At present, S. trutta have replaced O. mykiss in the majority of the Chitose River, although O. mykiss have persisted in areas above migration barriers that prevent S. trutta expansion.

Role of invasive Melilotus officinalis in two native plant communities,"This study examines the impact of the exotic nitrogen-fixing legume Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam. on native and exotic species cover in two Great Plains ecosystems in Badlands National Park, South Dakota. Melilotus is still widely planted and its effects on native ecosystems are not well studied. Melilotus could have direct effects on native plants, such as through competition or facilitation. Alternatively, Melilotus may have indirect effects on natives, e. g., by favoring exotic species which in turn have a negative effect on native species. This study examined these interactions across a 4-year period in two contrasting vegetation types: Badlands sparse vegetation and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) mixed-grass prairie. Structural equation models were used to analyze the pathways through which Melilotus, native species, and other exotic species interact over a series of 2-year time steps. Melilotus can affect native and exotic species both in the current year and in the years after its death (a lag effect). A lag effect is possible because the death of a Melilotus plant can leave an open, potentially nitrogen-enriched site on the landscape. The results showed that the relationship between Melilotus and native and exotic species varied depending on the habitat and the year. In Badlands sparse vegetation, there was a consistent, strong, and positive relationship between Melilotus cover and native and exotic species cover suggesting that Melilotus is acting as a nurse plant and facilitating the growth of other species. In contrast, in western wheatgrass prairie, Melilotus was acting as a weak competitor and had no consistent effect on other species. In both habitats, there was little evidence for a direct lag effect of Melilotus on other species. Together, these results suggest both facilitative and competitive roles for Melilotus, depending on the vegetation type it invades.","Role of invasive Melilotus officinalis in two native plant communities [SEP] This study examines the impact of the exotic nitrogen-fixing legume Melilotus officinalis (L.)

Anthropogenic subsidies mitigate environmental variability for insular rodents,"The exogenous input of nutrients and energy into island systems fuels a large array of consumers and drives bottom-up trophic cascades in island communities. The input of anthropogenic resources has increased on islands and particularly supplemented non-native consumers with extra resources. We test the hypothesis that the anthropogenic establishments of super-abundant gulls and invasive iceplants Carpobrotus spp. have both altered the dynamics of an introduced black rat Rattus rattus population. On Bagaud Island, two habitats have been substantially modified by the anthropogenic subsidies of gulls and iceplants, in contrast to the native Mediterranean scrubland with no anthropogenic inputs. Rats were trapped in all three habitats over two contrasting years of rainfall patterns to investigate: (1) the effect of anthropogenic subsidies on rat density, age-ratio and growth rates, and (2) the role of rainfall variability in modulating the effects of subsidies between years. We found that the growth rates of rats dwelling in the non-subsidized habitat varied with environmental fluctuation, whereas rats dwelling in the gull colony maintained high growth rates during both dry and rainy years. The presence of anthropogenic subsidies apparently mitigated environmental stress. Age ratio and rat density varied significantly and predictably among years, seasons, and habitats. While rat densities always peaked higher in the gull colony, especially after rat breeding in spring, higher captures of immature rats were recorded during the second year in all habitats, associated with higher rainfall. The potential for non-native rats to benefit from anthropogenic resources has important implications for the management of similar species on islands.","Anthropogenic subsidies mitigate environmental variability for insular rodents [SEP] The exogenous input of nutrients and energy into island systems fuels a large array of consumers and drives bottom-up trophic cascades in island communities.

Inhibition between invasives: a newly introduced predator moderates the impacts of a previously established invasive predator,"1. With continued globalization, species are being transported and introduced into novel habitats at an accelerating rate. Interactions between invasive species may provide important mechanisms that moderate their impacts on native species. 2. The European green crab Carcinus maenas is an aggressive predator that was introduced to the east coast of North America in the mid-1800s and is capable of rapid consumption of bivalve prey. A newer invasive predator, the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus, was first discovered on the Atlantic coast in the 1980s, and now inhabits many of the same regions as C. maenas within the Gulf of Maine. Using a series of field and laboratory investigations, we examined the consequences of interactions between these predators. 3. Density patterns of these two species at different spatial scales are consistent with negative interactions. As a result of these interactions, C. maenas alters its diet to consume fewer mussels, its preferred prey, in the presence of H. sanguineus. Decreased mussel consumption in turn leads to lower growth rates for C. maenas, with potential detrimental effects on C. maenas populations. 4. Rather than an invasional meltdown, this study demonstrates that, within the Gulf of Maine, this new invasive predator can moderate the impacts of the older invasive predator.","Inhibition between invasives: a newly introduced predator moderates the impacts of a previously established invasive predator [SEP] 1.

Introduced deer reduce native plant cover and facilitate invasion of non-native tree species: evidence for invasional meltdown,"Invasive species are a major threat to native communities and ecosystems worldwide. One factor frequently invoked to explain the invasiveness of exotic species is their release in the new habitat from control by natural enemies (enemy-release hypothesis). More recently, interactions between exotic species have been proposed as a potential mechanism to facilitate invasions (invasional meltdown hypothesis). We studied the effects of introduced deer on native plant communities and exotic plant species on an island in Patagonia, Argentina using five 400 m(2) exclosures paired with control areas in an Austrocedrus chilensis native forest stand. We hypothesized that introduced deer modify native understory composition and abundance and facilitate invasion of introduced tree species that have been widely planted in the region. After 4 years of deer exclusion, native Austrocedrus and exotic Pseudotsuga menziesii tree sapling abundances are not different inside and outside exclosures. However, deer browsing has strongly inhibited growth of native tree saplings (relative height growth is 77% lower with deer present), while exotic tree sapling growth is less affected (relative height growth is 3.3% lower). Deer significantly change abundance and composition of native understory plants. Cover of native plants in exclosures increased while cover in controls remained constant. Understory composition in exclosures after only 4 years differs greatly from that in controls, mainly owing to the abundance of highly-browsed native species. This study shows that introduced deer can aid the invasion of non-native tree species through negatively affecting native plant species.","Introduced deer reduce native plant cover and facilitate invasion of non-native tree species: evidence for invasional meltdown [SEP] Invasive species are a major threat to native communities and ecosystems worldwide.

"Range expansion of Agrilus convexicollis in European Russia expedited by the invasion of the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)","The jewel beetle Agrilus convexicollis Redtenbacher, 1849 (Buprestidae) occurs in many European and North Mediterranean countries and feeds mainly on dying shoots and branches of ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior, F. ornus and F. oxyphylla). A range map of A. convexicollis with 479 exact localities from the literature and museum collections is compiled. Historically, this species was not known to be present in the central region of European Russia. Since 2007, however, specimens of A. convexicollis have been collected in seven central European Russia localities, effectively expanding the northern border of the previously known range by approximately 665 km. All recently established localities of A. convexicollis are within the region invaded by emerald ash borer (A. planipennis Fairmaire), an East Asian pest of ashes that was first detected in European Russia in 2003. In addition, almost all A. convexicollis specimens from central European Russia (both adults and larvae) were collected from declining F. pennsylvanica (an introduced North American ash) infested with A. planipennis. This is a new host record for A. convexicollis. We suspect that the recent range expansion of A. convexicollis in central European Russia has been facilitated by the A. planipennis invasion, which has caused widespread decline and mortality of ash trees in the region.

In addition, almost all A. convexicollis specimens from central European Russia (both adults and larvae) were collected from declining F. pennsylvanica (an introduced North American ash) infested with A. planipennis. This is a new host record for A. convexicollis. We suspect that the recent range expansion of A. convexicollis in central European Russia has been facilitated by the A. planipennis invasion, which has caused widespread decline and mortality of ash trees in the region. This work illustrates how the invasion of one species can facilitate the range expansion of another.",8-0-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Invasive alien plants infiltrate bird-mediated shrub nucleation processes in arid savanna,"1. The cultivation and dissemination of alien ornamental plants increases their potential to invade. More specifically, species with bird-dispersed seeds can potentially infiltrate natural nucleation processes in savannas. 2. To test (i) whether invasion depends on facilitation by host trees, (ii) whether propagule pressure determines invasion probability, and (iii) whether alien host plants are better facilitators of alien fleshy-fruited species than indigenous species, we mapped the distribution of alien fleshy-fruited species planted inside a military base, and compared this with the distribution of alien and native fleshy-fruited species established in the surrounding natural vegetation. 3. Abundance and diversity of fleshy-fruited plant species was much greater beneath tree canopies than in open grassland and, although some native fleshy-fruited plants were found both beneath host trees and in the open, alien fleshy-fruited plants were found only beneath trees. 4. Abundance of fleshy-fruited alien species in the natural savanna was positively correlated with the number of individuals of those species planted in the grounds of the military base, while the species richness of alien fleshy-fruited taxa decreased with distance from the military base, supporting the notion that propagule pressure is a fundamental driver of invasions. 5. There were more fleshy-fruited species beneath native Acacia tortilis than beneath alien Prosopis sp. trees of the equivalent size. Although there were significant differences in native plant assemblages beneath these hosts, the proportion of alien to native fleshy-fruited species did not differ with host. 6. Synthesis. Birds facilitate invasion of a semi-arid African savanna by alien fleshy-fruited plants, and this process does not require disturbance. Instead, propagule pressure and a few simple biological observations define the probability that a plant will invade, with alien species planted in gardens being a major source of propagules. Some invading species have the potential to transform this savanna by overtopping native trees, leading to ecosystem-level impacts. Likewise, the invasion of the open savanna by alien host trees (such as Prosopis sp.) may change the diversity, abundance and species composition of the fleshy-fruited understorey. These results illustrate the complex interplay between propagule pressure, facilitation, and a range of other factors in biological invasions.","Invasive alien plants infiltrate bird-mediated shrub nucleation processes in arid savanna [SEP] 1.

Facilitation and competition among invasive plants: A field experiment with alligatorweed and water hyacinth,"Ecosystems that are heavily invaded by an exotic species often contain abundant populations of other invasive species. This may reflect shared responses to a common factor, but may also reflect positive interactions among these exotic species. Armand Bayou (Pasadena, TX) is one such ecosystem where multiple species of invasive aquatic plants are common. We used this system to investigate whether presence of one exotic species made subsequent invasions by other exotic species more likely, less likely, or if it had no effect. We performed an experiment in which we selectively removed exotic rooted and/or floating aquatic plant species and tracked subsequent colonization and growth of native and invasive species. This allowed us to quantify how presence or absence of one plant functional group influenced the likelihood of successful invasion by members of the other functional group. We found that presence of alligatorweed (rooted plant) decreased establishment of new water hyacinth (free-floating plant) patches but increased growth of hyacinth in established patches, with an overall net positive effect on success of water hyacinth. Water hyacinth presence had no effect on establishment of alligatorweed but decreased growth of existing alligatorweed patches, with an overall net negative effect on success of alligatorweed. Moreover, observational data showed positive correlations between hyacinth and alligatorweed with hyacinth, on average, more abundant. The negative effect of hyacinth on alligatorweed growth implies competition, not strong mutual facilitation (invasional meltdown), is occurring in this system. Removal of hyacinth may increase alligatorweed invasion through release from competition. However, removal of alligatorweed may have more complex effects on hyacinth patch dynamics because there were strong opposing effects on establishment versus growth. The mix of positive and negative interactions between floating and rooted aquatic plants may influence local population dynamics of each group and thus overall invasion pressure in this watershed.","Facilitation and competition among invasive plants: A field experiment with alligatorweed and water hyacinth [SEP] Ecosystems that are heavily invaded by an exotic species often contain abundant populations of other invasive species.

Positive effects of a dominant invader on introduced and native mudflat species,"Many introduced species have negative impacts on native species, but some develop positive interactions with both native species and other invaders. Facilitation between invaders may lead to an overall acceleration in invasion success and impacts. Mechanisms of facilitation include habitat alteration, or ecosystem engineering, and trophic interactions. In marine systems, only a handful of positive effects have been reported for invading species. In an unusual NE Pacific marine assemblage dominated by 5 conspicuous invaders and 2 native species, we identified positive effects of the most abundant invader, the Asian hornsnail Batillaria attramentaria, on all other species. B. attramentaria reached densities > 1400 m(-2), providing an average of 600 cm of hard substrate per m(2) on this mudflat, Its shells were used as habitat almost exclusively by the introduced Atlantic slipper shell Crepidula convexa, the introduced Asian anemone Diadumene lineata, and 2 native hermit crabs Pagurus hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus. In addition, manipulative experiments showed that the abundance of the mudsnail Nassarius fraterculus and percentage cover of the eelgrass Zostera japonica, both introduced from the NW Pacific, increased significantly in the presence of B. attramentaria. The most likely mechanisms for these facilitations are indirect grazing effects and bioturbation, respectively. Since the precise arrival dates of all these invaders are unknown, the role of B. attramentaria's positive interactions in their initial invasion success is unknown, Nevertheless, by providing habitat for 2 non-native epibionts and 2 native species, and by facilitating 2 other invaders, the non-native B. attramentaria enhances the level of invasion by all 6 species.","Positive effects of a dominant invader on introduced and native mudflat species [SEP] Many introduced species have negative impacts on native species, but some develop positive interactions with both native species and other invaders.

"Structural, compositional and trait differences between native- and non-native-dominated grassland patches","Non-native species with growth forms that are different from the native flora may alter the physical structure of the area they invade, thereby changing the resources available to resident species. This in turn can select for species with traits suited for the new growing environment. We used adjacent uninvaded and invaded grassland patches to evaluate whether the shift in dominance from a native perennial bunchgrass, Nassella pulchra, to the early season, non-native annual grass, Bromus diandrus, affects the physical structure, available light, plant community composition and community-weighted trait means. Our field surveys revealed that the exotic grass B.diandrus alters both the vertical and horizontal structure creating more dense continuous vegetative growth and dead plant biomass than patches dominated by N.pulchra. These differences in physical structure are responsible for a threefold reduction in available light and likely contribute to the lower diversity, especially of native forbs in B.diandrus-dominated patches. Further, flowering time began earlier and seed size and plant height were higher in B.diandrus patches relative to N.pulchra patches. Our results suggest that species that are better suited (earlier phenology, larger seed size and taller) for low light availability are those that coexist with B.diandrus, and this is consistent with our hypothesis that change in physical structure with B.diandrus invasion is an important driver of community and trait composition. The traits of species able to coexist with invaders are rarely considered when assessing community change following invasion; however, this may be a powerful approach for predicting community change in environments with high anthropogenic pressures, such as disturbance and nutrient enrichment. It also provides a means for selecting species to introduce when trying to enhance native diversity in an otherwise invaded community.","Structural, compositional and trait differences between native- and non-native-dominated grassland patches [SEP] Non-native species with growth forms that are different from the native flora may alter the physical structure of the area they invade, thereby changing the resources available to resident species.

Positive plant and bird diversity response to experimental deer population reduction after decades of uncontrolled browsing,"Aim During the 20th century, deer (family Cervidae), both native and introduced populations, dramatically increased in abundance in many parts of the world and became seen as major threats to biodiversity in forest ecosystems. Here, we evaluated the consequences that restoring top-down herbivore population control has on plants and birds. Location Forest ecosystems of Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada) where introduced black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have dramatically limited tree regeneration and simplified understorey plant, insect and bird assemblages. Methods We experimentally assessed ecosystem-wide responses of plant and bird communities to a similar to 80% reduction of deer abundance on two mediumsized islands (146 and 249 ha). We monitored changes in plant and bird communities for the 13 years following the start of culling and used two islands without culling and a set of exclosures as controls. Results Native plant communities increased in cover and richness after culling, while introduced plants decreased. Birds that depend on understorey vegetation for feeding and/or breeding increased significantly after deer were reduced in abundance but species not dependent on understorey vegetation did not. Finally, on control islands, plant and bird communities were stable or declined throughout the study period. Main conclusions Biodiversity losses caused by current continental-scale trends of increasing deer populations are potentially reversible. We demonstrate that controlling large herbivore populations (native or introduced) offers significant conservation benefits to forest understorey plant communities, even to those most negatively affected by uncontrolled browsing. We also report, for the first time, strong evidence that higher trophic levels (birds) can respond rapidly and positively to herbivore density control.","Positive plant and bird diversity response to experimental deer population reduction after decades of uncontrolled browsing [SEP] Aim During the 20th century, deer (family Cervidae), both native and introduced populations, dramatically increased in abundance in many parts of the world and became seen as major threats to biodiversity in forest ecosystems.

Does mutualism drive the invasion of two alien species? The case of Solenopsis invicta and Phenacoccus solenopsis,"Although mutualism between ants and honeydew-producing hemipterans has been extensively recognized in ecosystem biology, however few attempts to test the hypothesis that mutualism between two alien species leads to the facilitation of the invasion process. To address this problem, we focus on the conditional mutualism between S. invicta and P. solenopsis by field investigations and indoor experiments. In the laboratory, ant colony growth increased significantly when ants had access to P. solenopsis and animal-based food. Honeydew produced by P. solenopsis also improved the survival of ant workers. In the field, colony density of P. solenopsis was significantly greater on plots with ants than on plots without ants. The number of mealybug mummies on plants without fire ants was almost three times that of plants with fire ants, indicating a strong effect of fire ants on mealybug survival. In addition, the presence of S. invicta successfully contributed to the spread of P. solenopsis. The quantity of honeydew consumption by S. invicta was significantly greater than that of a presumptive native ant, Tapinoma melanocephalum. When compared with the case without ant tending, mealybugs tended by ants matured earlier and their lifespan and reproduction increased. T. melanocephalum workers arrived at honeydew more quickly than S. invicta workers, while the number of foraging S. invicta workers on plants steadily increased, eventually exceeding that number of T. melanocephalum foragers. Overall, these results suggest that the conditional mutualism between S. invicta and P. solenopsis facilitates population growth and fitness of both species. S. invicta tends to acquire much more honeydew and drive away native ants, promoting their predominance. These results suggest that the higher foraging tempo of S. invicta may provide more effective protection of P. solenopsis than native ants. Thus mutualism between these two alien species may facilitate the invasion success of both species.","Does mutualism drive the invasion of two alien species?

Invasion by a N2-fixing tree alters function and structure in wet lowland forests of Hawaii,"Invasive species pose major threats to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. When such species alter ecosystem processes, they have the potential to change the environmental context in which other species survive and reproduce and may also facilitate the invasion of additional species. We describe impacts of an invasive N2-fixing tree, Falcataria moluccana, on some of the last intact remnants of native wet lowland forest undergoing primary succession on 48-, 213-, and 300-yr-old lava flows of Kilauea Volcano on the island of Hawai'i. We measured litterfall, soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability, light availability, species composition, and forest structure in native-dominated stands and in stands invaded by Falcataria. Litter inputs increased 1.3-8.6 times, N mass of litterfall increased 4-55 times, and P mass of litterfall increased 2-28 times in invaded stands relative to native stands. C:N and C:P ratios of litterfall were lower, and N:P ratios higher, in invaded stands relative to native stands. Resin-captured soil N and P values were 17-121 and 2-24 times greater, respectively, in invaded stands relative to native stands on each of the three lava flows. Native species accounted for nearly 100% of total basal area and stem density in native stands, while alien species accounted for 68- 99% of total basal area, and 82-91% of total stem density, in invaded stands. Compositional changes following Falcataria invasion were due both to increases in alien species, particularly Psidium cattleianum, and decreases in native species, particularly Metrosideros polymorpha. Results provide a clear example of how invasive tree species, by modifying the function and structure of the ecosystems that they invade, can facilitate invasion by additional nonnative species and eliminate dominant native species. Given the rarity and limited extent of remaining native-dominated wet lowland forests in Hawaii, and the degree to which Falcataria invasion alters them, we expect that the continued existence of these unique ecosystems will be determined, in large part, by the spread of this invasive species.","Invasion by a N2-fixing tree alters function and structure in wet lowland forests of Hawaii [SEP] Invasive species pose major threats to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems.

We investigated the pollination system of banana passionfruit by comparing fruit set, fruit size, seed set, and germination success between hand-selfed, hand-crossed, bagged and open flowers, and inbreeding depression in seedlings grown in competition. Fruit set was reduced by 83% when pollinators were excluded (3.0% fruit set, compared with 18.0% for unmanipulated flowers) indicating reliance on pollinators for reproduction. While banana passionfruit is partially self-compatible, fruit set was significantly reduced in hand-selfed flowers (17.5%) compared with crossed flowers (29.5%), and we found significant pollen limitation (hand-crossed vs unmanipulated, Pollen Limitation Index = 0.39). There was no significant inbreeding depression found in fruit size, seeds per fruit, germination success, seedling growth or seedling survival. Combining these data showed that natural unmanipulated flowers produce more seedlings per flower (1.7) than bagged flowers (0.9), but fewer than hand-selfed (3.0) and hand-crossed (5.3) flowers.

Does whirling disease mediate hybridization between a native and nonnative trout?,"The spread of nonnative species over the last century has profoundly altered freshwater ecosystems, resulting in novel species assemblages. Interactions between nonnative species may alter their impacts on native species, yet few studies have addressed multispecies interactions. The spread of whirling disease, caused by the nonnative parasite Myxobolus cerebralis, has generated declines in wild trout populations across western North America. Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in the northern Rocky Mountains are threatened by hybridization with introduced Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Rainbow Trout are more susceptible to whirling disease than Cutthroat Trout and may be more vulnerable due to differences in spawning location. We hypothesized that the presence of whirling disease in a stream would (1) reduce levels of introgressive hybridization at the site scale and (2) limit the size of the hybrid zone at the whole-stream scale. We measured levels of introgression and the spatial extent of hybridization between Rainbow Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout in four disease-positive streams and six disease-negative streams within the Blackfoot River basin of Montana. In addition to disease status, we considered habitat quality, stream slope, distance from the confluence, temperature, and elevation. Whirling disease presence was not associated with either the level of introgression at a site or the size of the hybrid zone. Temperature, elevation, and stream slope were all influential in determining levels of introgression at the site scale. Stream slope was the most influential factor determining the size of the hybrid zone, as longer, steeper streams contained smaller hybrid zones. Stream slope is a driver of many habitat characteristics that may provide refuge from invasive species in the coming decades. Although the multispecies interactions examined in this study did not alter the impacts of invasion on native species, community assemblages will continue to change with the spread of nonnative species, requiring continued assessment to determine their impacts on native species.","Does whirling disease mediate hybridization between a native and nonnative trout?

The portability of foodweb dynamics: reassembling an Australian eucalypt-psyllid-bird association within California,"Aims To evaluate the role of native predators (birds) within an Australian foodweb (lerp psyllids and eucalyptus trees) reassembled in California. Location Eucalyptus groves within Santa Cruz, California. Methods We compared bird diversity and abundance between a eucalyptus grove infested with lerp psyllids and a grove that was uninfested, using point counts. We documented shifts in the foraging behaviour of birds between the groves using structured behavioural observations. Additionally, we judged the effect of bird foraging on lerp psyllid abundance using exclosure experiments. Results We found a greater richness and abundance of Californian birds within a psyllid infested eucalyptus grove compared to a matched non-infested grove, and that Californian birds modify their foraging behaviour within the infested grove in order to concentrate on ingesting psyllids. This suggests that Californian birds could provide indirect top-down benefits to eucalyptus trees similar to those observed in Australia. However, using bird exclosure experiments, we found no evidence of top-down control of lerp psyllids by Californian birds. Main conclusions We suggest that physiological and foraging differences between Californian and Australian pysllid-eating birds account for the failure to observe top-down control of psyllid populations in California. The increasing rate of non-indigenous species invasions has produced local biotas that are almost entirely composed of non-indigenous species. This example illustrates the complex nature of cosmopolitan native-exotic food webs, and the ecological insights obtainable through their study.","The portability of foodweb dynamics: reassembling an Australian eucalypt-psyllid-bird association within California [SEP] Aims To evaluate the role of native predators (birds) within an Australian foodweb (lerp psyllids and eucalyptus trees) reassembled in California.

Global patterns in threats to vertebrates by biological invasions,"Biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss have recently been challenged. Fundamentally, we must know where species that are threatened by invasive alien species (IAS) live, and the degree to which they are threatened. We report the first study linking 1372 vertebrates threatened by more than 200 IAS from the completely revised Global Invasive Species Database. New maps of the vulnerability of threatened vertebrates to IAS permit assessments of whether IAS have a major influence on biodiversity, and if so, which taxonomic groups are threatened and where they are threatened. We found that centres of IAS-threatened vertebrates are concentrated in the Americas, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. The areas in which IAS-threatened species are located do not fully match the current hotspots of invasions, or the current hotspots of threatened species. The relative importance of biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss clearly varies across regions and taxa, and changes over time, with mammals from India, Indonesia, Australia and Europe are increasingly being threatened by IAS. The chytrid fungus primarily threatens amphibians, whereas invasive mammals primarily threaten other vertebrates. The differences in IAS threats between regions and taxa can help efficiently target IAS, which is essential for achieving the Strategic Plan 2020 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Global patterns in threats to vertebrates by biological invasions [SEP] Biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss have recently been challenged.

Early emergence and resource availability can competitively favour natives over a functionally similar invader,"Invasive plant species can form dense populations across large tracts of land. Based on these observations of dominance, invaders are often described as competitively superior, despite little direct evidence of competitive interactions with natives. The few studies that have measured competitive interactions have tended to compare an invader to natives that are unlikely to be strong competitors because they are functionally different. In this study, we measured competitive interactions among an invasive grass and two Australian native grasses that are functionally similar and widely distributed. We conducted a pair-wise glasshouse experiment, where we manipulated both biotic factors (timing of establishment, neighbour identity and density) and abiotic factors (nutrients and timing of water supply). We found that the invader significantly suppressed the performance of the natives; but its suppression ability was contingent on resource levels, with pulsed water/low nutrients or continuous watering reducing its competitive effects. The native grasses were able to suppress the performance of the invader when given a 3-week head-start, suggesting the invader may be incapable of establishing unless it emerges first, including in its own understorey. These findings provide insight for restoration, as the competitive effect of a functionally similar invader may be reduced by altering abiotic and biotic conditions in favour of natives.","Early emergence and resource availability can competitively favour natives over a functionally similar invader [SEP] Invasive plant species can form dense populations across large tracts of land.

Community assembly and invasion: An experimental test of neutral versus niche processes,"A species-addition experiment showed that prairie grasslands have a structured, nonneutral assembly process in which resident species inhibit, via resource consumption, the establishment and growth of species with similar resource use patterns and in which the success of invaders decreases as diversity increases. In our experiment, species in each of four functional guilds were introduced, as seed, into 147 prairie-grassland plots that previously had been established and maintained to have different compositions and diversities. Established species most strongly inhibited introduced species from their own functional guild. introduced species attained lower abundances when functionally similar species were abundant and when established species left lower levels of resources unconsumed, which occurred at lower species richness. Residents of the C4 grass functional guild, the dominant guild in nearby native grasslands, reduced the major limiting resource, soil nitrate, to the lowest levels in midsummer and exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on introduced species. This simple mechanism of greater competitive inhibition of invaders that are similar to established abundant species could, in theory, explain many of the patterns observed in plant communities.","Community assembly and invasion: An experimental test of neutral versus niche processes [SEP] A species-addition experiment showed that prairie grasslands have a structured, nonneutral assembly process in which resident species inhibit, via resource consumption, the establishment and growth of species with similar resource use patterns and in which the success of invaders decreases as diversity increases.

A test of the effects of functional group richness and composition on grassland invasibility,"Although many theoretical and observational studies suggest that diverse systems are more resistant to invasion by novel species than are less diverse systems, experimental data are uncommon. In this experiment, I manipulated the functional group richness and composition of a grassland community to test two related hypotheses: (1) Diversity and invasion resistance are positively related through diversity's effects on the resources necessary for invading plants' growth. (2) Plant communities resist invasion by species in functional groups already present in the community. To test these hypotheses, I removed plant functional groups (forbs, C3 graminoids, and C4 graminoids) from existing grassland vegetation to create communities that contained all possible combinations of one, two, or three functional groups. After three years of growth, I added seeds of 16 different native prairie species (legumes, nonleguminous forbs, C3 graminoids, and C4 graminoids) to a1 3 1 m portion of each 4 3 8 m plot. Overall invasion success was negatively related to resident functional group richness, but there was only weak evidence that resident species repelled functionally similar invaders. A weak effect of functional group richness on some resources did not explain the significant diversity-invasibility relationship. Other factors, particularly the different responses of resident functional groups to the initial disturbance of the experimental manipulation, seem to have been more important to community in- vasibility.","A test of the effects of functional group richness and composition on grassland invasibility [SEP] Although many theoretical and observational studies suggest that diverse systems are more resistant to invasion by novel species than are less diverse systems, experimental data are uncommon.

Invasive Microstegium populations consistently outperform native range populations across diverse environments,"Plant species introduced into novel ranges may become invasive due to evolutionary change, phenotypic plasticity, or other biotic or abiotic mechanisms. Evolution of introduced populations could be the result of founder effects, drift, hybridization, or adaptation to local conditions, which could enhance the invasiveness of introduced species. However, understanding whether the success of invading populations is due to genetic differences between native and introduced populations may be obscured by origin 3 environment interactions. That is, studies conducted under a limited set of environmental conditions may show inconsistent results if native or introduced populations are differentially adapted to specific conditions. We tested for genetic differences between native and introduced populations, and for origin 3 environment interactions, between native (China) and introduced (U. S.) populations of the invasive annual grass Microstegium vimineum (stiltgrass) across 22 common gardens spanning a wide range of habitats and environmental conditions. On average, introduced populations produced 46% greater biomass and had 7.4% greater survival, and outperformed native range populations in every common garden. However, we found no evidence that introduced Microstegium exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity than native populations. Biomass of Microstegium was positively correlated with light and resident community richness and biomass across the common gardens. However, these relationships were equivalent for native and introduced populations, suggesting that the greater mean performance of introduced populations is not due to unequal responses to specific environmental parameters. Our data on performance of invasive and native populations suggest that post-introduction evolutionary changes may have enhanced the invasive potential of this species. Further, the ability of Microstegium to survive and grow across the wide variety of environmental conditions demonstrates that few habitats are immune to invasion.","Invasive Microstegium populations consistently outperform native range populations across diverse environments [SEP] Plant species introduced into novel ranges may become invasive due to evolutionary change, phenotypic plasticity, or other biotic or abiotic mechanisms.

Phenotypic variability in Holcus lanatus L. in southern Chile: a strategy that enhances plant survival and pasture stability,"Holcus lanatus L. can colonise a wide range of sites within the naturalised grassland of the Humid Dominion of Chile. The objectives were to determine plant growth mechanisms and strategies that have allowed H. lanatus to colonise contrasting pastures and to determine the existence of ecotypes of H. lanatus in southern Chile. Plants of H. lanatus were collected from four geographic zones of southern Chile and established in a randomised complete block design with four replicates. Five newly emerging tillers were marked per plant and evaluated at the vegetative, pre-ear emergence, complete emerged in florescence, end of flowering period, and mature seed stages. At each evaluation, one marked tiller was harvested per plant. The variables measured included lamina length and width, tiller height, length of the in florescence, total number of leaves, and leaf, stem, and in florescence mass. At each phenological stage, groups of accessions were statistically formed using cluster analysis. The grouping of accessions (cluster analysis) into statistically different groups (ANOVA and canonical variate analysis) indicated the existence of different ecotypes. The phenotypic variation within each group of the accessions suggested that each group has its own phenotypic plasticity. It is concluded that the successful colonisation by H. lanatus has resulted from diversity within the species.","Phenotypic variability in Holcus lanatus L. in southern Chile: a strategy that enhances plant survival and pasture stability [SEP] Holcus lanatus L. can colonise a wide range of sites within the naturalised grassland of the Humid Dominion of Chile.

Crab-mediated phenotypic changes in Spartina densiflora Brong,"Although plant phenotypic plasticity has been historically studied as an important adaptive strategy to overcome herbivory and environmental heterogeneity, there are several aspects of its ecological importance that remain controversial. The burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata eats Spartina densiflora, and also causes several geomorphologic changes that indirectly affect Spartina growth. Here we evaluate if this crab affects the sexual reproductive effort of S. densiflora by mediating changes in plant phenotypic plasticity (i.e., shape of leaves and spikes) while affecting aboveground production, and if these effects interact with disturbance intensity. We conducted local and regional surveys and two-year field experiments manipulating the density of crabs in a mature Spartina marsh where we clipped at ground level different I x I in marsh areas to create and compare crab's effect on young (plants growing after the clipping) and mature (unclipped) Spartina stands. Our results suggest that crabs mediate the phenotypic plasticity of sexual reproductive structures of Spartina. Crabs induced an increase in seed production (up to 721%) and seed viability, potentially favoring Spartina dispersal and colonization of distant sites. This effect appears to be maximal when combined with the experimental clipping disturbance. Crabs also exerted a strong effect on clipped plants by increasing the number of standing dead stems and decreasing the photosynthetic area and leaf production. These effects disappear in about two years if no other disturbance occurs. An a posteriori regional field survey agreed with our experimental results corroborating the prediction that plants in old undisturbed marshes have lower sexual reproductive effort than plants in highly disturbed marshes populated by burrowing-herbivore crabs. All these phenotypic changes have important taxonomic and macro-ecological implications that should not be ignored in discussions of applied ecology and environmental management.

Differential patterns of plasticity to water availability along native and naturalized latitudinal gradients,"Questions: Does plasticity to water availability differ between native and naturalized and laboratory plant accessions? Is there a relationship between morphological plasticity and a fitness measure? Can we account for latitudinal patterns of plasticity with rainfall data from the seed source location? Organism: We examined an array of 23 native, 14 naturalized, and 5 laboratory accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. Methods: We employed a split-plot experimental design in the greenhouse with two water treatments. We measured morphological and fitness-related traits at various developmental stages. We utilized a published dataset representing 30-year average precipitation trends for each accession origin. Results: We detected evidence of differential patterns of plasticity between native, naturalized, and laboratory populations for several morphological traits. Native, laboratory, and naturalized populations also differed in which traits were positively associated with fitness, and did not follow the Jack-of-all-trades or Master-of-some scenarios. Significant negative relationships were detected for plasticity in morphological traits with latitude.

"Growth, water relations, and stomatal development of Caragana korshinskii Kom. and Zygophyllum xanthoxylum (Bunge) Maxim. seedlings in response to water deficits","The selection and introduction of drought tolerant species is a common method of restoring degraded grasslands in and environments. This study investigated the effects of water stress on growth, water relations, Na+ and K+ accumulation, and stomatal development in the native plant species Zygophyllum xanthoxylum (Bunge) Maxim., and an introduced species, Caragana korshinskii Kom., under three watering regimes. Moderate drought significantly reduced pre-dawn water potential, leaf relative water content, total biomass, total leaf area, above-ground biomass, total number of leaves and specific leaf area, but it increased the root/total weight ratio (0.23 versus 0.33) in C. korshinskii. Only severe drought significantly affected water status and growth in Z. xanthoxylum. In any given watering regime, a significantly higher total biomass was observed in Z xanthoxylum (1.14 g) compared to C. korshinskii (0.19 g). Moderate drought significantly increased Na+ ccumulation in all parts of Z xanthoxylum, e.g., moderate drought increased leaf Na+ concentration from 1.14 to 2.03 g/100 g DW, however, there was no change in Na+ (0.11 versus 0.12) in the leaf of C. korshinskii when subjected to moderate drought. Stomatal density increased as water availability was reduced in both C. korshinskii and Z xanthoxylum, but there was no difference in stomatal index of either species. Stomatal length and width, and pore width were significantly reduced by moderate water stress in Z xanthoxylum, but severe drought was required to produce a significant effect in C. korshinskii. These results indicated that C. korshinskii is more responsive to water stress and exhibits strong phenotypic plasticity especially in above-ground/below-ground biomass allocation. In contrast, Z xanthoxylum was more tolerant to water deficit, with a lower specific leaf area and a strong ability to maintain water status through osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure, thereby providing an effective strategy to cope with local extreme and environments.","Growth, water relations, and stomatal development of Caragana korshinskii Kom. and Zygophyllum xanthoxylum (Bunge) Maxim. seedlings in response to water deficits [SEP] The selection and introduction of drought tolerant species is a common method of restoring degraded grasslands in and environments.

Multiple common garden experiments suggest lack of local adaptation in an invasive ornamental plant,"Aims Adaptive evolution along geographic gradients of climatic conditions is suggested to facilitate the spread of invasive plant species, leading to clinal variation among populations in the introduced range. We investigated whether adaptation to climate is also involved in the invasive spread of an ornamental shrub, Buddleja davidii, across western and central Europe. Methods dWe combined a common garden experiment, replicated in three climatically different central European regions, with reciprocal transplantation to quantify genetic differentiation in growth and reproductive traits of 20 invasive B. davidii populations. Additionally, we compared compensatory regrowth among populations after clipping of stems to simulate mechanical damage. Important Findings Our results do not provide evidence for clinal variation among invasive B. davidii populations: populations responded similarly to the different environments, and trait values were not correlated to climatic conditions or geographic coordinates of their home sites. Moreover, we did not detect differences in the compensatory ability of populations. We suppose that the invasive spread of B. davidii has been facilitated by phenotypic plasticity rather than by adaptation to climate and that continent-wide shuffling of cultivars due to horticultural trade may have limited local adaptation so far.","Multiple common garden experiments suggest lack of local adaptation in an invasive ornamental plant [SEP] Aims Adaptive evolution along geographic gradients of climatic conditions is suggested to facilitate the spread of invasive plant species, leading to clinal variation among populations in the introduced range.

VARIATION IN PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AMONG NATIVE AND INVASIVE POPULATIONS OF ALLIARIA PETIOLATA,"Alliaria petiolata is a Eurasian biennial herb that is invasive in North America and for which phenotypic plasticity has been noted as a potentially important invasive trait. Using four European and four North American populations, we explored variation among populations in the response of a suite of antioxidant, antiherbivore, and morphological traits to the availability of water and nutrients and to jasmonic acid treatment. Multivariate analyses revealed substantial variation among populations in mean levels of these traits and in the response of this suite of traits to environmental variation, especially water availability.

Using four European and four North American populations, we explored variation among populations in the response of a suite of antioxidant, antiherbivore, and morphological traits to the availability of water and nutrients and to jasmonic acid treatment. Multivariate analyses revealed substantial variation among populations in mean levels of these traits and in the response of this suite of traits to environmental variation, especially water availability.

Nitrogen acquisition by annual and perennial grass seedlings: testing the roles of performance and plasticity to explain plant invasion,"Differences in resource acquisition between native and exotic plants is one hypothesis to explain invasive plant success. Mechanisms include greater resource acquisition rates and greater plasticity in resource acquisition by invasive exotic species compared to non-invasive natives. We assess the support for these mechanisms by comparing nitrate acquisition and growth of invasive annual and perennial grass seedlings in western North America. Two invasive exotic grasses (Bromus tectorum and Taeniatherum caput-medusae) and three perennial native and exotic grasses (Pseudoroegneria spicata, Elymus elymoides, and Agropyron cristatum) were grown at various temperatures typical of autumn and springtime when resource are abundant and dominance is determined by rapid growth and acquisition of resources. Bromus tectorum and perennial grasses had similar rates of nitrate acquisition at low temperature, but acquisition by B. tectorum significantly exceeded perennial grasses at higher temperature. Consequently, B. tectorum had the highest acquisition plasticity, showcasing its ability to take advantage of transient warm periods in autumn and spring. Nitrate acquisition by perennial grasses was limited either by root production or rate of acquisition per unit root mass, suggesting a trade-off between nutrient acquisition and allocation of growth to structural tissues. Our results indicate the importance of plasticity in resource acquisition when temperatures are warm such as following autumn emergence by B. tectorum. Highly flexible and opportunistic nitrate acquisition appears to be a mechanism whereby invasive annual grasses exploit soil nitrogen that perennials cannot use.","Nitrogen acquisition by annual and perennial grass seedlings: testing the roles of performance and plasticity to explain plant invasion [SEP] Differences in resource acquisition between native and exotic plants is one hypothesis to explain invasive plant success.

Acclimation effects on thermal tolerances of springtails from sub-Antarctic Marion Island: Indigenous and invasive species,"Collembola are abundant and functionally significant arthropods in sub-Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, and their importance has increased as a consequence of the many invasive alien species that have been introduced to the region. It has also been predicted that current and future climate change will favour alien over indigenous species as a consequence of more favourable responses to warming in the former. It is therefore surprising that little is known about the environmental physiology of sub-Antarctic springtails and that few studies have explicitly tested the hypothesis that invasive species will outperform indigenous ones under warmer conditions. Here we present thermal tolerance data on three invasive (Pogonognathellus flavescens, Isotomurus cf. palustris, Ceratophysella denticulata) and two indigenous (Cryptopygus antarcticus, Tullbergia bisetosa) species of springtails from Marion Island, explicitly testing the idea that consistent differences exist between the indigenous and invasive species both in their absolute limits and the ways in which they respond to acclimation (at temperatures from 0 to 20 degrees C). Phenotypic plasticity is the first in a series of ways in which organisms might respond to altered environments. Using a poorly explored, but highly appropriate technique, we demonstrate that in these species the crystallization temperature (T-c) is equal to the lower lethal temperature. We also show that cooling rate (I degrees C min(-1); 0.1 degrees C min(-1); 0.5 degrees C h(-1) from 5 to -1 degrees C followed by 0.1 degrees C min(-1)) has little effect on Tc. The indigenous species typically have low T(c)s (c. -20 to - 13 degrees C depending on the acclimation temperature), whilst those of the invasive species tend to be higher (c. - 12 to - 6 degrees C) at the lower acclimation temperatures. However, Ceratophysella denticulata is an exception with a low T-c (c. -20 to - 18 degrees C), and in P. flavescens acclimation to 20 degrees C results in a pronounced decline in T-c. In general, the invasive and alien species do not differ substantially in acclimation effects on T-c (with the exception of the strong response in P. flavescens). Upper lethal temperatures (ULT50) are typically higher in the invasive (33-37 degrees C) than in the indigenous (30-33 degrees C) species and the response to acclimation differs among the two groups. The indigenous species show either a weak response to acclimation or ULT50 declines with increasing acclimation temperature, whereas in the invasive species ULT50 increases with acclimation temperature. These findings support the hypothesis that many invasive species will be favoured by climate change (warming and drying) at Marion Island. Moreover, manipulative field experiments have shown abundance changes in the indigenous and invasive springtail species in the direction predicted by the physiological data.

Can life-history traits predict the fate of introduced species? A case study on two cyprinid fish in southern France,"1. The ecological and economic costs of introduced species can be high. Ecologists try to predict the probability of success and potential risk of the establishment of recently introduced species, given their biological characteristics. 2. In 1990 gudgeon, Gobio gobio, were released in a drainage canal of the Rhone delta of southern France. The Asian topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva, was found for the first time in the same canal in 1993. Those introductions offered a unique opportunity to compare in situ the fate of two closely related fish in the same habitat. 3. Our major aims were to assess whether G. gobio was able to establish in what seemed an unlikely environment, to compare populations trends and life-history traits of both species and to assess whether we could explain or could have predicted our results, by considering their life-history strategies. 4. Data show that both species have established in the canal and have spread. Catches of P. parva have increased strongly and are now higher than those of G. gobio. 5. The two cyprinids have the same breeding season and comparable traits (such as short generation time, small body, high reproductive effort), so both could be classified as opportunists. The observed difference in their success (in terms of population growth and colonization rate) could be explained by the wider ecological and physiological tolerance of P. parva. 6. In conclusion, our field study seems to suggest that invasive vigour also results from the ability to tolerate environmental changes through phenotypic plasticity, rather than from particular life-history features pre-adapted to invasion. It thus remains difficult to define a good invader simply on the basis of its life-history features.","Can life-history traits predict the fate of introduced species?

A reassessment of the role of propagule pressure in influencing fates of passerine introductions to New Zealand,"Several studies have argued that principal factor in determining the fate of bird introductions is introduction effort. In large part, these studies have emerged from analyses of historical records from a single place-New Zealand. Here we raise two concerns about these conclusions. First, we argue that although many bird species were introduced repeatedly to New Zealand, in many cases the introductions apparently occurred only after the species were already successfully naturalized. The inclusion of such seemingly superfluous introductions may exaggerate the importance of propagule pressure. And second, we question the reliability of the records themselves. In many cases these records are equivocal, as inconsistencies appear in separate studies of the same records. Our analysis indicates that species were successful not because they were introduced frequently and in high numbers, but rather it is likely that they were introduced frequently and in high numbers because the initial releases were successful.","A reassessment of the role of propagule pressure in influencing fates of passerine introductions to New Zealand [SEP] Several studies have argued that principal factor in determining the fate of bird introductions is introduction effort.

Predictors of avian and mammalian translocation success: reanalysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts,"We use the phylogenetically based statistical method of independent contrasts to reanalyze the Wolf et al., 1996translocation data set for 181 programs involving 17 mammalian and 28 avian species. Although still novel in conservation and wildlife biology, the incorporation of phylogenetic information into analyses of interspecific comparative data is widely accepted and routinely used in several fields. To facilitate application of independent contrasts, we converted the dichotomous (success/failure) dependent variable (Wolf et al. 1996, Griffith et al. 1989. Translocations as a species conservation tool: status and strategy. Science 245, 477-480) into a more descriptive, continuous variable with the incorporation of persistence of the translocated population beyond the last release year, relative to the species' longevity. For comparison, we present three models: nonphylogenetic multiple logistic regression with the dichotomous dependent variable (the method used by Wolf et al. 1996and Griffith et al. 1989), nonphylogenetic multiple regression with the continuous dependent variable, and multiple regression using phylogenetically independent contrasts with the continuous dependent variable. Results of the phylogenetically based multiple regression analysis indicate statistical significance of three independent variables: habitat quality of the release area, range of the release site relative to the historical distribution of the translocated species, and number of individuals released. Evidence that omnivorous species are more successful than either herbivores or carnivores is also presented. The results of our reanalysis support several of the more important conclusions of the Wolf et al. (1996)and Griffith et al. (1989)studies and increase our confidence that the foregoing variables should be considered carefully when designing a translocation program. However, the phylogenetically based analysis does not support either the Wolf et al. (1996)or Griffith et al.

From the backyard to the backcountry: how ecological and biological traits explain the escape of garden plants into Mediterranean old fields,"To explain current ornamental plant invasions, or predict future ones, it is necessary to determine which factors increase the probability of an alien species becoming invasive. Here, we focused on the early phases of ornamental plant invasion in order to identify which plant features and cultivation practices may favor the escape of ornamental plants from domestic gardens to abandoned agricultural land sites in the Mediterranean Region. We used an original approach which consisted in visiting 120 private gardens in an urbanizing rural area of the French Mediterranean backcountry, and then visited surrounding old fields to determine which planted species had escaped out of the gardens. We built a database of 407 perennial ornamental alien species (most of which were animal-dispersed), and determined nineteen features that depicted the strength of species' propagule pressure within gardens, the match between species requirements and local physical environment, and each species' reproductive characteristics. Using standard and phylogenetic logistic regression, we found that ornamental alien plants were more likely to have escaped if they were planted in gardens' margins, if they had a preference for dry soil, were tolerant to high-pH or pH-indifferent, and if they showed a capacity for clonal growth. Focusing only on animal-dispersed plants, we found that alien plants were more likely to have escaped if they were abundant in gardens and showed preference for dry soil. This suggests that gardening practices have a primary impact on the probability of a species to escape from cultivation, along with species pre-adaptation to local soil conditions, and capacity of asexual reproduction. Our results may have important implications for the implementation of management practices and awareness campaigns in order to limit ornamental plants to becoming invasive species in Mediterranean landscapes.","From the backyard to the backcountry: how ecological and biological traits explain the escape of garden plants into Mediterranean old fields [SEP] To explain current ornamental plant invasions, or predict future ones, it is necessary to determine which factors increase the probability of an alien species becoming invasive.

Reproductive potential and seedling establishment of the invasive alien tree Schinus molle (Anacardiaceae) in South Africa,"Schinus molle (Peruvian pepper tree) was introduced to South Africa more than 150 years ago and was widely planted, mainly along roads. Only in the last two decades has the species become naturalized and invasive in some parts of its new range, notably in semi-arid savannas. Research is being undertaken to predict its potential for further invasion in South Africa. We studied production, dispersal and predation of seeds, seed banks, and seedling establishment in relation to land uses at three sites, namely ungrazed savanna once used as a military training ground; a savanna grazed by native game; and an ungrazed mine dump. We found that seed production and seed rain density of S. molle varied greatly between study sites, but was high at all sites (384 864-1 233 690 seeds per tree per year; 3877-9477 seeds per square metre per year). We found seeds dispersed to distances of up to 320 m from female trees, and most seeds were deposited within 50 m of putative source trees. Annual seed rain density below canopies of Acacia tortillis, the dominant native tree at all sites, was significantly lower in grazed savanna. The quality of seed rain was much reduced by endophagous predators. Seed survival in the soil was low, with no survival recorded beyond 1 year. Propagule pressure to drive the rate of recruitment: densities of seedlings and sapling densities were higher in ungrazed savanna and the ungrazed mine dump than in grazed savanna, as reflected by large numbers of young individuals, but adult : seedling ratios did not differ between savanna sites. Frequent and abundant seed production, together with effective dispersal of viable S. molle seed by birds to suitable establishment sites below trees of other species to overcome predation effects, facilitates invasion. Disturbance enhances invasion, probably by reducing competition from native plants.","Reproductive potential and seedling establishment of the invasive alien tree Schinus molle (Anacardiaceae) in South Africa [SEP] Schinus molle (Peruvian pepper tree) was introduced to South Africa more than 150 years ago and was widely planted, mainly along roads.

Restoration of species-rich grasslands on ex-arable land: Seed addition outweighs soil fertility reduction,"A common practice in biodiversity conservation is restoration of former species-rich grassland on ex-arable land. Major constraints for grassland restoration are high soil fertility and limited dispersal ability of plant species to target sites. Usually, studies focus on soil fertility or on methods to introduce plant seeds. However, the question is whether soil fertility reduction is always necessary for getting plant species established on target sites. In a three-year field experiment with ex-arable soil with intensive farming history, we tested single and combined effects of soil fertility reduction and sowing mid-successional plant species on plant community development and soil biological properties. A controlled microcosm study was performed to test short-term effects of soil fertility reduction measures on biomass production of mid-successional species. Soil fertility was manipulated by adding carbon (wood or straw) to incorporate plant-available nutrients into organic matter, or by removing nutrients through top soil removal (TSR). The sown species established successfully and their establishment was independent of carbon amendments. TSR reduced plant biomass, and effectively suppressed arable weeds, however, created a desert-like environment, inhibiting the effectiveness of sowing mid-successional plant species. Adding straw or wood resulted in short-term reduction of plant biomass, suggesting a temporal decrease in plant-available nutrients by microbial immobilisation. Straw and wood addition had little effects on soil biological properties, whereas TSR profoundly reduced numbers of bacteria, fungal biomass and nematode abundance. In conclusion, in ex-arable soils, on a short-term sowing is more effective for grassland restoration than strategies aiming at soil fertility reduction.

A global meta-analysis of the ecological impacts of nonnative crayfish,"Nonnative crayfish have been widely introduced and are a major threat to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Despite documentation of the ecological effects of nonnative crayfish from >3 decades of case studies, no comprehensive synthesis has been done to test quantitatively for their general or species-specific effects on recipient ecosystems. We provide the first global meta-analysis of the ecological effects of nonnative crayfish under experimental settings to compare effects among species and across levels of ecological organization. Our meta-analysis revealed strong, but variable, negative ecological impacts of nonnative crayfish with strikingly consistent effects among introduced species. In experimental settings, nonnative crayfish generally affect all levels of freshwater food webs. Nonnative crayfish reduce the abundance of basal resources like aquatic macrophytes, prey on invertebrates like snails and mayflies, and reduce abundances and growth of amphibians and fish, but they do not consistently increase algal biomass. Nonnative crayfish tend to have larger positive effects on growth of algae and larger negative effects on invertebrates and fish than native crayfish, but effect sizes vary considerably. Our study supports the assessment of crayfish as strong interactors in food webs that have significant effects across native taxa via polytrophic, generalist feeding habits. Nonnative crayfish species identity may be less important than extrinsic attributes of the recipient ecosystems in determining effects of nonnative crayfish. We identify some understudied and emerging nonnative crayfish that should be studied further and suggest expanding research to encompass more comparisons of native vs nonnative crayfish and different geographic regions. The consistent and general negative effects of nonnative crayfish warrant efforts to discourage their introduction beyond native ranges.","A global meta-analysis of the ecological impacts of nonnative crayfish [SEP] Nonnative crayfish have been widely introduced and are a major threat to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Nonnative crayfish species identity may be less important than extrinsic attributes of the recipient ecosystems in determining effects of nonnative crayfish. We identify some understudied and emerging nonnative crayfish that should be studied further and suggest expanding research to encompass more comparisons of native vs nonnative crayfish and different geographic regions. The consistent and general negative effects of nonnative crayfish warrant efforts to discourage their introduction beyond native ranges.",9-1-0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Predictors of introduction success in the South Florida avifauna,"Biological invasions are an increasing global challenge, for which single-species studies and analyses focused on testing single hypotheses of causation in isolation are unlikely to provide much additional insight. Species interact with other species to create communities, which derive from species interactions and from the interactions of species with the scale specific elements of the landscape that provide suitable habitat and exploitable resources. I used logistic regression analysis to sort among potential intrinsic, community and landscape variables that theoretically influence introduction success. I utilized the avian fauna of the Everglades of South Florida, and the variables body mass, distance to nearest neighbor (in terms of body mass), year of introduction, presence of congeners, guild membership, continent of origin, distribution in a body mass aggregation or gap, and distance to body-mass aggregation edge (in terms of body mass). Two variables were significant predictors of introduction success. Introduced avian species whose body mass placed them nearer to a body-mass aggregation edge and further from their neighbor were more likely to become successfully established. This suggests that community interactions, and community level phenomena, may be better understood by explicitly incorporating scale.","Predictors of introduction success in the South Florida avifauna [SEP] Biological invasions are an increasing global challenge, for which single-species studies and analyses focused on testing single hypotheses of causation in isolation are unlikely to provide much additional insight.

"Catalogue of alien plants of the Czech Republic (2nd edition): checklist update, taxonomic diversity and invasion patterns","A complete list of all alien taxa ever recorded in the flora of the Czech Republic is presented as an update of the original checklist published in 2002. New data accumulated in the last decade are incorporated and the listing and status of some taxa are reassessed based on improved knowledge. Alien flora of the Czech Republic consists of 1454 taxa listed with information on their taxonomic position, life history, geographic origin (or mode of origin, distinguishing anecophyte and hybrid), invasive status (casual; naturalized but not invasive; invasive), residence time status (archaeophyte vs neophyte), mode of introduction into the country (accidental, deliberate), and date of the first record. Additional information on species performance that was not part of the previous catalogue, i.e. on the width of species' habitat niches, their dominance in invaded communities, and impact, is provided. The Czech alien flora consists of 350 (24.1%) archaeophytes and 1104 (75.9%) neophytes.The increase in the total number of taxa compared to the previous catalogue (1378) is due to addition of 151 taxa and removal of 75 (39 archaeophytes and 36 neophytes), important part of the latter being the reclassification of 41 taxa as native, mostly based on archaeobotanical evidence. The additions represent taxa newly recorded since 2002 and reported in the national literature; taxa resulting from investigation of sources omitted while preparing the previous catalogue; redetermination of previously reported taxa; reassessment of some taxa traditionally considered native for which the evidence suggests the opposite; and inclusion of intraspecific taxa previously not recognized in the flora. There are 44 taxa on the list that are reported in the present study for the first time as aliens introduced to the Czech Republic or escaped from cultivation: Abies concolor, A. grandis, A. nordmanniana, Avena sterilis subsp. ludoviciana, A.  vilis, Berberis julianae, B. thunbergii, Bidens ferulifolius, Buddleja alternifolia, Buglossoides incrassata subsp. splitgerberi, Buxus sempervirens, Corispermum declinatum, Cotoneaster dielsianus, C. divaricatus, Euphorbia myrsinites, Gleditsia triacanthos, Helleborus orientalis, Hieracium heldreichii, Koelreuteria paniculata, Lonicera periclymenum, Lotus ornithopodioides, Malus baccata, M. pumila, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Morus alba, Muscari armeniacum, Paeonia lactiflora, Pennisetum alopecuroides, Pinguicula crystallina subsp. hirtiflora, P. grandiflora subsp. rosea, Podophyllum hexandrum, Pyracantha coccinea, Rhodotypos scandens, Rumex patientia   R. tianschanicus 'Uteuša', Salix cordata, Sarracenia purpurea, Sasa palmata 'Nebulosa', Scolymus maculatus, Spiraea japonica, Tagetes tenuifolia, Thuja occidentalis, Trifolium badium, Vaccinium corymbosum and Viburnum rhytidophyllum. All added and deleted taxa are commented on. Of the total number of taxa, 985 are classified as casuals, 408 as naturalized but not invasive, and 61 as invasive. The reduction in the number of invasive taxa compared to the previous catalogue is due to a more conservative approach adopted here; only taxa that currently spread are considered invasive. Casual taxa are strongly overrepresented among neophytes compared to archaeophytes (76.7% vs 39.4%), while naturalized but non-invasive taxa follow the reversed pattern (18.8% vs 57.4). However, these two groups do not significantly differ in the proportion of invasive taxa. Of introduced neophytes, 250 taxa (22.6%) are considered vanished, i.e. no longer present in the flora, while 23.3% became naturalized, and 4.5% invasive. In addition to the traditional classification based on introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum, taxa were classified into 18 population groups based on their long-term trends in metapopulation dynamics in the country, current state of their populations, and link to the propagule pressure from cultivation. Mapping these population groups onto the unified framework for biological invasions introduced by Blackburn et al. in 2011 made it possible to quantify invasion failures, and boom-and-busts, in the Czech alien flora. Depending on inclusion criteria (whether or not extinct/vanished taxa and hybrids are considered), alien taxa ever recorded in the Czech Republic contribute 29.7-33.1% to the total country's plant diversity; taking into account only naturalized taxa, a permanent element of the country's flora, the figure is 14.4-17.5%. Analysis of the dates of the first record, known for 771 neophytes, indicates that alien taxa in the flora have been increasing at a steady pace without any distinct deceleration trend; by extrapolating this data to all 1104 neophytes recorded it is predicted that the projected number would reach 1264 in 2050. Deliberate introduction was involved in 747 cases (51.4%), the remaining 48.6% of taxa are assumed to have arrived by unintentional pathways. Archaeophytes are more abundant in landscapes, occupy on average a wider range of habitat types than neophytes, but reach a lower cover in plant communities. The alien flora is further analysed with respect to representation of genera and families, origin and life history.","Catalogue of alien plants of the Czech Republic (2nd edition): checklist update, taxonomic diversity and invasion patterns [SEP] A complete list of all alien taxa ever recorded in the flora of the Czech Republic is presented as an update of the original checklist published in 2002.

"The potential impact of the New Zealand flatworm, a predator of earthworms, in western Europe","The New Zealand flatworm Arthurdendyus triangulatus (= Artioposthia triangulata) is an example of an invasive organism that, by reducing lumbricid earthworm populations, could have a major impact on soil ecosystems in Britain and the Faroe Islands. How it was introduced into the British Isles is not known, but like many invasive species, it is suspected that it was introduced by humans and was associated with the trade between New Zealand and Britain. Once established in Britain it found in the large, readily available earthworm population a niche that it could exploit. The microclimate of the forests in the center and south of the South Island of New Zealand from whence the flatworm came is similar to that in parts of the British Isles and consequently conducive to its survival. Although when compared with many other invertebrate introductions (e.g., insects) the flatworm's rate of increase has been slow, a retrospective study strongly suggested that, in Scotland, they spread from botanic gardens to horticultural wholesalers, then to domestic gardens, and only latterly did they invade agricultural land. As with other invasive species, the application of the CLIMEX computer model and geographic-information-system techniques have been used to try to ascertain its potential distribution within both the British Isles and Europe. The data suggest that A. triangulatus could become established in northwest continental Europe, and Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden have added it to their quarantine pest lists. The fact that A. triangulatus is the only one of 12 alien terrestrial planarians in Britain to be considered a pest suggests that this group of invertebrates is behaving in a fashion similar to other invasive organisms and obeys the ""tens rule"" suggested by M. Williamson. Since within the period 1995-1997 another three species of predatory terrestrial planarians have been recorded in Scotland it is evident that the existing phytosanitary regulations must be more strongly enforced or new ones introduced if the spread of terrestrial planarians is to be halted.","The potential impact of the New Zealand flatworm, a predator of earthworms, in western Europe [SEP] The New Zealand flatworm Arthurdendyus triangulatus (= Artioposthia triangulata) is an example of an invasive organism that, by reducing lumbricid earthworm populations, could have a major impact on soil ecosystems in Britain and the Faroe Islands.

Life-history traits of non-native fishes in Iberian watersheds across several invasion stages: a first approach,"Freshwater ecosystems are seriously imperiled by the spread of non-native fishes thus establishing profiles of their life-history characteristics is an emerging tool for developing conservation and management strategies. We did a first approach to determine characteristics of successful and failed non-native fishes in a Mediterranean-climate area, the Iberian Peninsula, for three stages of the invasion process: establishment, spread and integration. Using general linear models, we established which characteristics are most important for success at each invasion stage. Prior invasion success was a good predictor for all the stages of the invasion process. Biological variables relevant for more than one invasion stage were maximum adult size and size of native range. Despite these common variables, all models produced a different set of variables important for a successful invasion, demonstrating that successful invaders have a combination of biological traits that may favor success at all invasion stages. However, some differences were found in relation to published studies on fish invasions in other Mediterranean-climate areas, suggesting that characteristics of the recipient ecosystem are as relevant as the characteristics of the invading species.","Life-history traits of non-native fishes in Iberian watersheds across several invasion stages: a first approach [SEP] Freshwater ecosystems are seriously imperiled by the spread of non-native fishes thus establishing profiles of their life-history characteristics is an emerging tool for developing conservation and management strategies.
